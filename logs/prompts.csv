An appar- ently apolitical choice‚Äîfor example, treating all data points used to train an AI model equally ‚Äîcan result in models that are more accurate in regions where the density and quality of data is higher; these often coincide with the northern and western areas of the world (e.g., [1, 2]). Inequity in the access to data and computational resources exacerbates gaps between com- munities in understanding climate change impacts and acting towards mitigation and adapta- tion, often in ways that are detrimental to those who are most affected (e.g., [3, 4]). While these issues are not exclusive to AI, widespread opacity in the development and functioning of AI models, presentation of AI model outcomes, and the rapid evolution of the AI field further increase the inequality in power and agency among differently resourced parties. This creates an opportunity for climate scientists to rethink the role of ethics in their approach to research. There are many ways in which climate scientists can interact with soci- ety. Here we focus on the process of scientific research, identifying some good practices for building trustworthy and responsible models and then providing some resources. In creating and training models, we encourage researchers to recognize that science cannot claim to be purely ‚Äúobjective‚Äù, and that the choice of priors, data, and metrics all carry biases (e.g., [5]). Resolving or eliminating them is not realistic, as the interpretation of a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù model or result is highly dependent on the user‚Äôs specific goal. Hence, it is crucial to be open and specific about the assumptions made, the algorithms and hyperparameters used, and the evaluation metrics and processes, and ideally to also make data and code available, following the principles of reproducible science (e.g., [6]). In evaluating and presenting the performance of statistical or machine learning models, considering possible failure modes can be a useful lens through which to examine systems‚Äô behaviors. Good starting points are the taxonomy proposed by [7], which considers flaws in design, implementation, and communication, and, specifically for climate science, the list compiled by [8]. Failure modes that are particularly relevant for AI models from the climate domain include robustness under distribution shifts; for example, for models trained on his- torical data, it is difficult to predict how they will perform in the unseen conditions brought about by climate change. Good practices induced by consideration of failure modes may include efforts to quantify expected model performance through simulations, transparency in defining the anticipated range of applicability of the model, and considering how existing physics/climate knowledge can be applied in defining an evaluation strategy and in validating PLOS CLIMATE PLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000465 August 2, 2024 1 / 4 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Acquaviva V, Barnes EA, Gagne DJ, II, McKinley GA, Thais S (2024) Ethics in climate AI: From theory to practice.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. the generalization properties of the model. A related practice is to consider how the functional- ity lens changes and what failure modes become relevant when looking at the whole ‚Äúphase space‚Äù of a model, intended as the array of different breakdowns of data, such as geographical areas, time periods, or user groups, as well as the broader socio-technical context in which a model can be used beyond the use case for which it was developed. In creating and distributing data sets, a term we use to indicate both observational data and other products such as outputs of Earth System Models, we begin by recognizing that we typi- cally don‚Äôt hold power on who will use the data and how the data will be used. We can, how- ever, aim to provide clear documentation on what dataset or numerical model creators thought of as desired and pertinent usage, as well as undesired, inappropriate, or wrong usage. Additionally, we can aim to be as transparent as possible in language and jargon in order to make climate information more widely accessible to a broad range of users and decision mak- ers; see, e.g., [9] for example of potential pitfalls when datasets are used across domains. A pos- sible pipeline to consider when creating data sets is provided by the Datasheets for Earth Science Datasets [10]. When possible, we propose to prefer AI models that are intrinsically interpretable (some- times defined as those built from pieces whose behavior is interpretable, such as decision trees or linear models) or explainable (sometimes defined as those whose behavior and decisions can be explained post hoc, for example, by means of a simpler surrogate model; see e.g., [11]). Interpretability and explainability can protect us from dangerous failure modes by creating insights into the ability of our model to generalize beyond the training domain, allowing us to check whether the explanation is consistent with our understanding of a physical system, and by allowing access to a wider and more inclusive user base, for example those who are not fully trained in or don‚Äôt have the resources to run more complex models, such as deep learning methods. However, applying explainability tools or using interpretable methods is not always possible or practical. We would like to propose a wider interpretation of explainability, which includes interrogating the system by exploring its responses to a wide range of inputs, includ- ing distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. In addition, we can perform physically informed perturbations of the system that act on the spatial, temporal or phenomenological scales of interest to assess their impact. By studying the behavior of AI systems under varied circum- stances, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding that is a proxy for explainability. An important reflection on encouraging the use of broadly-defined explainable models, as well as the need for clear documentation mentioned above, is that creating well-documented and explainable models can be a much slower process than using potentially more powerful, but black-box, methods. Generating physically meaningful features that can improve perfor- mance, implementing frameworks to enhance explainability, and writing documentation are time-consuming processes. Hence, rewarding the creation of such models requires a culture shift. Our current incen- tive structure is not built to reward this approach. Most often, the threshold for publication is set by an improvement in model performance typically measured by model accuracy on a pre- chosen data set. Furthermore, the measure of academic ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù (and in return, the chances to secure academic positions or grant funding, or to win awards) is heavily influenced by the number of papers and conference papers, creating pressure to publish more but not necessarily to curate impact. We can, however, challenge and change the status quo, by leading by example in our research, fostering a culture of explainable work in our labs, and appropriately reward- ing well-documented, explainable, robust, and broadly impactful work when evaluating papers, proposals, job applications, and nominations for awards. Besides being ethical, this culture shift in climate data science is made crucial by the fact that many private companies, including Google Deep Mind, NVIDIA, and Microsoft, are now PLOS CLIMATE PLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000465 August 2, 2024 2 / 4 racing ahead of academic centers in building complex machine learning-based climate and weather models (e.g., [12]). With very few exceptions, the computational resources available to universities won‚Äôt match those offered by tech giants, but we can and must retain the impor- tant role of creating generalizable insights and providing, with each of our papers and prod- ucts, a foundation for others to improve on our work. If we collaborate or work for these private companies, we should also remain aware of the potential for them to limit access to the information we produce. Finally, we would like to emphasize that ethical AI and science are intertwined, interdepen- dent topics. We should begin to include ethics in the climate science discourse, starting in the classroom. It is important to have these conversations in undergraduate and graduate courses and to integrate relevant resources in the climate science curricula, as well as at climate science conferences through special sessions. Starting points for such conversations include: ‚Ä¢ The lectures of the Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Science 2022 Sum- mer School [13]; ‚Ä¢ AI Ethics Education for Scientists [14]; ‚Ä¢ AI Ethics and Fundamental Physics [15]. The benefits of applying principles of ethical AI in scientific inquiry and to reward explain- ability, robustness, and trustworthiness are many: making more information available to more people, empowering communities affected by climate change, making climate research more impactful and accessible, and increasing the level of interaction and trust between climate sci- entists and society. This comes at the price of a culture shift where scientists are called to build models and data sets according to certain principles, to change the system of incentives in order to reward slower but more robust, explainable, and transparent work, and to engage in discussing and teaching the ethical aspects of climate data science as early as possible.

This work examines the intersection of ethics and AI in climate science, highlighting significant societal implications:

### Key Points:

- **Data Inequity:** AI models often perform better in data-rich regions, typically in the Global North, which can exacerbate disparities in addressing climate change impacts.

- **Transparency and Bias:** There's a need to recognize biases in AI models, including choices of data and metrics. Science is not purely objective, so assumptions must be clearly stated.

- **Failure Modes:** Consider potential failures in AI models, especially under varying climate conditions. Models should be transparent about their limits and evaluation strategies.

- **Interpretable Models:** Preference should be given to interpretable or explainable models to understand AI behavior better. This ensures models are accessible to a wider audience.

- **Documentation and Explainability:** Well-documented explainable models should be encouraged, even if they take longer to develop. Current incentive structures often undervalue this approach.

- **Ethical Integration:** Ethics should be incorporated into climate science education and research, with discussions at conferences and in curricula.

### Broader Implications:

- **Cultural Shift:** Emphasizing ethics and explainability requires a change in academic and research cultures to value robust and transparent work over rapid publication.

- **Collaboration with Tech:** While tech companies advance rapidly in climate AI, academia must focus on creating generalizable insights and maintaining transparency.

- **Educational Resources:** The paper points to resources for integrating ethics into climate science education, fostering a more ethically aware generation of scientists.

Overall, the work calls for a thoughtful approach to integrating ethics into climate AI, ensuring fair and robust scientific practices that benefit society as a whole. üåéüìä"

John McCarthy Computer Science Department Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 jmc@cs.stanford.edu http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/ 2007 Nov 12, 2:05 a.m. Revised November 12, 2007: Abstract This article for the layman answers basic questions about artificial intelligence. The opinions expressed here are not all consensus opinion among researchers in AI. 1 Basic Questions Q. What is artificial intelligence? A. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, es- pecially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. Q. Yes, but what is intelligence? A. Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines. Q. Isn‚Äôt there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn‚Äôt depend on relating it to human intelligence? 2 A. Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent. We understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others. Q. Is intelligence a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question ‚ÄúIs this machine intelligent or not?‚Äù? A. No. Intelligence involves mechanisms, and AI research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others. If doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today, computer pro- grams can give very impressive performances on these tasks. Such programs should be considered ‚Äúsomewhat intelligent‚Äù. Q. Isn‚Äôt AI about simulating human intelligence? A. Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use meth- ods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do. Q. What about IQ? Do computer programs have IQs? A. No. IQ is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children. It is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the child‚Äôs age. The scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. IQ correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life, but making computers that can score high on IQ tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness. For example, the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities, perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with at once. However, ‚Äúdigit span‚Äù is trivial for even extremely limited computers. However, some of the problems on IQ tests are useful challenges for AI. Q. What about other comparisons between human and computer intelli- gence? Arthur R. Jensen [Jen98], a leading researcher in human intelligence, suggests ‚Äúas a heuristic hypothesis‚Äù that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that diÔ¨Äerences in intelligence are related to ‚Äúquantitative biochemical and physiological conditions‚Äù. I see them as speed, short term memory, and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories. Whether or not Jensen is right about human intelligence, the situation in 3 AI today is the reverse. Computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs. Some abilities that children normally don‚Äôt develop till they are teenagers may be in, and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are. Very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for AI can usefully be diÔ¨Äerent from that in people. Whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people, this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task eÔ¨Éciently. Q. When did AI research start? A. After WWII, a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines. The English mathematician Alan Turing may have been the first. He gave a lecture on it in 1947. He also may have been the first to decide that AI was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines. By the late 1950s, there were many researchers on AI, and most of them were basing their work on programming computers. Q. Does AI aim to put the human mind into the computer? A. Some researchers say they have that objective, but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically. The human mind has a lot of peculiarities, and I‚Äôm not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them. Q. What is the Turing test? A. Alan Turing‚Äôs 1950 article Computing Machinery and Intelligence [Tur50] discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent. He argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledge- able observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent. This test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers. The observer could in- teract with the machine and a human by teletype (to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person), and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer. The Turing test is a one-sided test. A machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent, but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human. Daniel Dennett‚Äôs book Brainchildren [Den98] has an excellent discussion 4 of the Turing test and the various partial Turing tests that have been im- plemented, i.e. with restrictions on the observer‚Äôs knowledge of AI and the subject matter of questioning. It turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent. Q. Does AI aim at human-level intelligence? A. Yes. The ultimate eÔ¨Äort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans. However, many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious. Q. How far is AI from reaching human-level intelligence? When will it happen? A. A few people think that human-level intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for ex- pressing knowledge. However, most AI researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required, and therefore it cannot be predicted when human-level intelligence will be achieved. Q. Are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent? A. Computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine. Many researchers invented non-computer machines, hoping that they would be intelligent in diÔ¨Äerent ways than the computer programs could be. However, they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building. Because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster, another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine. Q. Are computers fast enough to be intelligent? A. Some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas. My own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them. Of course, quite apart from the ambitions of AI researchers, computers will keep getting faster. Q. What about parallel machines? A. Machines with many processors are much faster than single proces- sors can be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary to face this awkwardness. Q. What about making a ‚Äúchild machine‚Äù that could improve by reading and by learning from experience? 5 A. This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s. Even- tually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven‚Äôt yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading. Q. Might an AI system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about AI? A. I think yes, but we aren‚Äôt yet at a level of AI at which this process can begin. Q. What about chess? A. Alexander Kronrod, a Russian AI researcher, said ‚ÄúChess is the Drosophila of AI.‚Äù He was making an analogy with geneticists‚Äô use of that fruit fly to study inheritance. Playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others. Chess programs now play at grandmaster level, but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player, substituting large amounts of computation for understanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can build human-level chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs. Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making com- puters play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific do- main. It is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their eÔ¨Äorts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races. Q. What about Go? A. The Chinese and Japanese game of Go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving. Go exposes the weakness of our present under- standing of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing. Go programs are very bad players, in spite of considerable eÔ¨Äort (not as much as for chess). The problem seems to be that a position in Go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction. Humans use this in chess also, but chess programs consider the position as a whole. Chess programs com- pensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or, in the case of Deep Blue, many millions of times as much computation. Sooner or later, AI research will overcome this scandalous weakness. Q. Don‚Äôt some people say that AI is a bad idea? A. The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological ma- chine being intelligent is incoherent. He proposes the Chinese room argument www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/chinese.html The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus 6 says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn‚Äôt reached human level by now, it must be impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt. Q. Aren‚Äôt computability theory and computational complexity the keys to AI? [Note to the layman and beginners in computer science: These are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science, and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical.] A. No. These theories are relevant but don‚Äôt address the fundamental problems of AI. In the 1930s mathematical logicians, especially Kurt G¬®odel and Alan Tur- ing, established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains. Whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example, and whether a poly- nomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another. Hu- mans solve problems in these domains all the time, and this has been oÔ¨Äered as an argument (usually with some decorations) that computers are intrinsi- cally incapable of doing what people do. Roger Penrose claims this. However, people can‚Äôt guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either. See my Review of The Emperor‚Äôs New Mind by Roger Penrose. More essays and reviews defending AI research are in [McC96a]. In the 1960s computer scientists, especially Steve Cook and Richard Karp developed the theory of NP-complete problem domains. Problems in these domains are solvable, but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem. Which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an NP-complete problem domain. Humans often solve problems in NP-complete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms, but can‚Äôt solve them quickly in general. What is important for AI is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems. The identification of subdomains for which good algo- rithms exist is important, but a lot of AI problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains. The theory of the diÔ¨Éculty of general classes of problems is called com- putational complexity. So far this theory hasn‚Äôt interacted with AI as much as might have been hoped. Success in problem solving by humans and by AI programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the AI community 7 have been able to identify precisely. Algorithmic complexity theory as developed by SolomonoÔ¨Ä, Kolmogorov and Chaitin (independently of one another) is also relevant. It defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it. Proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem, but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you can‚Äôt prove that the program is the shortest. 2 Branches of AI Q. What are the branches of AI? A. Here‚Äôs a list, but some branches are surely missing, because no-one has identified them yet. Some of these may be regarded as concepts or topics rather than full branches. logical AI What a program knows about the world in general the facts of the specific situation in which it must act, and its goals are all represented by sentences of some mathematical logical language. The program decides what to do by inferring that certain actions are ap- propriate for achieving its goals. The first article proposing this was [McC59]. [McC89] is a more recent summary. [McC96b] lists some of the concepts involved in logical aI. [Sha97] is an important text. search AI programs often examine large numbers of possibilities, e.g. moves in a chess game or inferences by a theorem proving program. Discover- ies are continually made about how to do this more eÔ¨Éciently in various domains. pattern recognition When a program makes observations of some kind, it is often programmed to compare what it sees with a pattern. For example, a vision program may try to match a pattern of eyes and a nose in a scene in order to find a face. More complex patterns, e.g. in a natural language text, in a chess position, or in the history of some event are also studied. These more complex patterns require quite diÔ¨Äerent methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied the most. 8 representation Facts about the world have to be represented in some way. Usually languages of mathematical logic are used. inference From some facts, others can be inferred. Mathematical logical deduction is adequate for some purposes, but new methods of non- monotonic inference have been added to logic since the 1970s. The simplest kind of non-monotonic reasoning is default reasoning in which a conclusion is to be inferred by default, but the conclusion can be withdrawn if there is evidence to the contrary. For example, when we hear of a bird, we man infer that it can fly, but this conclusion can be reversed when we hear that it is a penguin. It is the possibil- ity that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that constitutes the non-monotonic character of the reasoning. Ordinary logical reasoning is monotonic in that the set of conclusions that can the drawn from a set of premises is a monotonic increasing function of the premises. Circumscription is another form of non-monotonic reasoning. common sense knowledge and reasoning This is the area in which AI is farthest from human-level, in spite of the fact that it has been an active research area since the 1950s. While there has been considerable progress, e.g. in developing systems of non-monotonic reasoning and theories of action, yet more new ideas are needed. The Cyc system contains a large but spotty collection of common sense facts. learning from experience Programs do that. The approaches to AI based on connectionism and neural nets specialize in that. There is also learn- ing of laws expressed in logic. [Mit97] is a comprehensive undergrad- uate text on machine learning. Programs can only learn what facts or behaviors their formalisms can represent, and unfortunately learn- ing systems are almost all based on very limited abilities to represent information. planning Planning programs start with general facts about the world (es- pecially facts about the eÔ¨Äects of actions), facts about the particular situation and a statement of a goal. From these, they generate a strat- egy for achieving the goal. In the most common cases, the strategy is just a sequence of actions. epistemology This is a study of the kinds of knowledge that are required for solving problems in the world. 9 ontology Ontology is the study of the kinds of things that exist. In AI, the programs and sentences deal with various kinds of objects, and we study what these kinds are and what their basic properties are. Emphasis on ontology begins in the 1990s. heuristics A heuristic is a way of trying to discover something or an idea imbedded in a program. The term is used variously in AI. Heuristic functions are used in some approaches to search to measure how far a node in a search tree seems to be from a goal. Heuristic predicates that compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than the other, i.e. constitutes an advance toward the goal, may be more useful. [My opinion]. genetic programming Genetic programming is a technique for getting pro- grams to solve a task by mating random Lisp programs and selecting fittest in millions of generations. It is being developed by John Koza‚Äôs group and here‚Äôs a tutorial1 . 3 Applications of AI Q. What are the applications of AI? A. Here are some. game playing You can buy machines that can play master level chess for a few hundred dollars. There is some AI in them, but they play well against people mainly through brute force computation‚Äîlooking at hundreds of thousands of positions. To beat a world champion by brute force and known reliable heuristics requires being able to look at 200 million positions per second. speech recognition In the 1990s, computer speech recognition reached a practical level for limited purposes. Thus United Airlines has replaced its keyboard tree for flight information by a system using speech recog- nition of flight numbers and city names. It is quite convenient. On the the other hand, while it is possible to instruct some computers using speech, most users have gone back to the keyboard and the mouse as still more convenient. 1http://www.genetic-programming.com/gpanimatedtutorial.html 10 understanding natural language Just getting a sequence of words into a computer is not enough. Parsing sentences is not enough either. The computer has to be provided with an understanding of the domain the text is about, and this is presently possible only for very limited domains. computer vision The world is composed of three-dimensional objects, but the inputs to the human eye and computers‚Äô TV cameras are two di- mensional. Some useful programs can work solely in two dimensions, but full computer vision requires partial three-dimensional informa- tion that is not just a set of two-dimensional views. At present there are only limited ways of representing three-dimensional information di- rectly, and they are not as good as what humans evidently use. expert systems A ‚Äúknowledge engineer‚Äù interviews experts in a certain do- main and tries to embody their knowledge in a computer program for carrying out some task. How well this works depends on whether the intellectual mechanisms required for the task are within the present state of AI. When this turned out not to be so, there were many dis- appointing results. One of the first expert systems was MYCIN in 1974, which diagnosed bacterial infections of the blood and suggested treatments. It did better than medical students or practicing doctors, provided its limitations were observed. Namely, its ontology included bacteria, symptoms, and treatments and did not include patients, doc- tors, hospitals, death, recovery, and events occurring in time. Its in- teractions depended on a single patient being considered. Since the experts consulted by the knowledge engineers knew about patients, doctors, death, recovery, etc., it is clear that the knowledge engineers forced what the experts told them into a predetermined framework. In the present state of AI, this has to be true. The usefulness of current expert systems depends on their users having common sense. heuristic classification One of the most feasible kinds of expert system given the present knowledge of AI is to put some information in one of a fixed set of categories using several sources of information. An example is advising whether to accept a proposed credit card purchase. Information is available about the owner of the credit card, his record of payment and also about the item he is buying and about the estab- lishment from which he is buying it (e.g., about whether there have 11 been previous credit card frauds at this establishment). 4 More questions Q. How is AI research done? A. AI research has both theoretical and experimental sides. The experi- mental side has both basic and applied aspects. There are two main lines of research. One is biological, based on the idea that since humans are intelligent, AI should study humans and imitate their psychology or physiology. The other is phenomenal, based on studying and formalizing common sense facts about the world and the problems that the world presents to the achievement of goals. The two approaches interact to some extent, and both should eventually succeed. It is a race, but both racers seem to be walking. Q. What are the relations between AI and philosophy? A. AI has many relations with philosophy, especially modern analytic philosophy. Both study mind, and both study common sense. The best reference is [Tho03]. Q. How are AI and logic programming related? A. At the very least, logic programming provides useful programming languages (mainly Prolog). Beyond that, sometimes a theory T useful in AI can be expressed as a col- lection H of Horn clauses, and goal G to be achieved can be expressed as that of finding values of variables x1 . . . xn satisfying an expression g(x1 . . . xn). The problem can sometimes be solved by running the Prolog program con- sisting of G and H. There are two possible obstacles to regarding AI as logic programming. First, Horn theories do not exhaust first order logic. Second, the Prolog program expressing the theory may be extremely ineÔ¨Écient. More elaborate control than just executing the program that expresses the theory is often needed. Map coloring provides examples. Q. What should I study before or while learning AI? A. Study mathematics, especially mathematical logic. The more you learn about sciences, e.g. physics or biology, the better. For the biological approaches to AI, study psychology and the physiology of the nervous system. Learn some programming languages‚Äîat least C, Lisp and Prolog. It is also a good idea to learn one basic machine language. Jobs are likely to depend on 12 knowing the languages currently in fashion. In the late 1990s, these include C++ and Java. Q. What is a good textbook on AI? A. Artificial Intelligence by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Prentice Hall is the most commonly used textbbook in 1997. The general views expressed there do not exactly correspond to those of this essay. Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis by Nils Nilsson, Morgan Kaufman, may be easier to read. Some people prefer Computational Intelligence by David Poole, Alan Mack- worth and Randy Goebel, Oxford, 1998. Q. What organizations and publications are concerned with AI? A. The American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)2, the Eu- ropean Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI)3 and the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behavior (AISB)4 are scientific societies concerned with AI research. The Association for Comput- ing Machinery (ACM) has a special interest group on artificial intelligence SIGART5 . The International Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI)6 is the main inter- national conference. The AAAI7 runs a US National Conference on AI. Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence8 , Artificial Intelligence9 , and Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research10, and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence11 are four of the main journals publishing AI research papers.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines and computer programs. It focuses on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence.

**Intelligence Definition:** Intelligence involves achieving goals and exhibits varying kinds and degrees across humans, animals, and machines. There's no solid definition independent of human intelligence currently.

**Human vs AI:** AI doesn't aim to just simulate human intelligence; it often approaches problems differently using methods beyond human observation.

**Capabilities and Progress:** Computers possess speed and memory, but their intelligence is tied to what designers understand. Some abilities advance beyond human levels, while others remain limited.

**Origins and Goals:** AI research dates back to post-WWII and includes efforts to achieve human-level intelligence, though new ideas are still required.

**Branches of AI:**
- **Logical AI:** Using logical languages to make decisions.
- **Search:** Handling large possibilities like chess moves.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Matching observations to patterns.
- **Inference:** Drawing conclusions from facts.
- **Common Sense:** Much progress needed in mimicking human reasoning.

**Applications:** AI is used in game playing, speech recognition, natural language understanding, computer vision, expert systems, and heuristic classification.

**Challenges and Controversies:** Philosophical debates exist on the potential and limitations of AI, with arguments about its feasibility and morality.

**AI and Philosophy:** AI has many connections with philosophy, especially in understanding mind and common sense.

**Study Recommendations:** Mathematics, logic, sciences, and programming are essential for studying AI.

Overall, AI is a complex, multidisciplinary field that seeks to replicate and enhance human-like cognitive abilities in machines, with substantial ongoing research and application development. üåçüíª"

John McCarthy Computer Science Department Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 jmc@cs.stanford.edu http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/ 2007 Nov 12, 2:05 a.m. Revised November 12, 2007: Abstract This article for the layman answers basic questions about artificial intelligence. The opinions expressed here are not all consensus opinion among researchers in AI. 1 Basic Questions Q. What is artificial intelligence? A. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, es- pecially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. Q. Yes, but what is intelligence? A. Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines. Q. Isn‚Äôt there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn‚Äôt depend on relating it to human intelligence? 2 A. Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent. We understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others. Q. Is intelligence a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question ‚ÄúIs this machine intelligent or not?‚Äù? A. No. Intelligence involves mechanisms, and AI research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others. If doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today, computer pro- grams can give very impressive performances on these tasks. Such programs should be considered ‚Äúsomewhat intelligent‚Äù. Q. Isn‚Äôt AI about simulating human intelligence? A. Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use meth- ods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do. Q. What about IQ? Do computer programs have IQs? A. No. IQ is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children. It is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the child‚Äôs age. The scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. IQ correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life, but making computers that can score high on IQ tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness. For example, the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities, perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with at once. However, ‚Äúdigit span‚Äù is trivial for even extremely limited computers. However, some of the problems on IQ tests are useful challenges for AI. Q. What about other comparisons between human and computer intelli- gence? Arthur R. Jensen [Jen98], a leading researcher in human intelligence, suggests ‚Äúas a heuristic hypothesis‚Äù that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that diÔ¨Äerences in intelligence are related to ‚Äúquantitative biochemical and physiological conditions‚Äù. I see them as speed, short term memory, and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories. Whether or not Jensen is right about human intelligence, the situation in 3 AI today is the reverse. Computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs. Some abilities that children normally don‚Äôt develop till they are teenagers may be in, and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are. Very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for AI can usefully be diÔ¨Äerent from that in people. Whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people, this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task eÔ¨Éciently. Q. When did AI research start? A. After WWII, a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines. The English mathematician Alan Turing may have been the first. He gave a lecture on it in 1947. He also may have been the first to decide that AI was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines. By the late 1950s, there were many researchers on AI, and most of them were basing their work on programming computers. Q. Does AI aim to put the human mind into the computer? A. Some researchers say they have that objective, but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically. The human mind has a lot of peculiarities, and I‚Äôm not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them. Q. What is the Turing test? A. Alan Turing‚Äôs 1950 article Computing Machinery and Intelligence [Tur50] discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent. He argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledge- able observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent. This test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers. The observer could in- teract with the machine and a human by teletype (to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person), and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer. The Turing test is a one-sided test. A machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent, but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human. Daniel Dennett‚Äôs book Brainchildren [Den98] has an excellent discussion 4 of the Turing test and the various partial Turing tests that have been im- plemented, i.e. with restrictions on the observer‚Äôs knowledge of AI and the subject matter of questioning. It turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent. Q. Does AI aim at human-level intelligence? A. Yes. The ultimate eÔ¨Äort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans. However, many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious. Q. How far is AI from reaching human-level intelligence? When will it happen? A. A few people think that human-level intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for ex- pressing knowledge. However, most AI researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required, and therefore it cannot be predicted when human-level intelligence will be achieved. Q. Are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent? A. Computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine. Many researchers invented non-computer machines, hoping that they would be intelligent in diÔ¨Äerent ways than the computer programs could be. However, they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building. Because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster, another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine. Q. Are computers fast enough to be intelligent? A. Some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas. My own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them. Of course, quite apart from the ambitions of AI researchers, computers will keep getting faster. Q. What about parallel machines? A. Machines with many processors are much faster than single proces- sors can be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary to face this awkwardness. Q. What about making a ‚Äúchild machine‚Äù that could improve by reading and by learning from experience? 5 A. This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s. Even- tually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven‚Äôt yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading. Q. Might an AI system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about AI? A. I think yes, but we aren‚Äôt yet at a level of AI at which this process can begin. Q. What about chess? A. Alexander Kronrod, a Russian AI researcher, said ‚ÄúChess is the Drosophila of AI.‚Äù He was making an analogy with geneticists‚Äô use of that fruit fly to study inheritance. Playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others. Chess programs now play at grandmaster level, but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player, substituting large amounts of computation for understanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can build human-level chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs. Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making com- puters play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific do- main. It is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their eÔ¨Äorts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races. Q. What about Go? A. The Chinese and Japanese game of Go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving. Go exposes the weakness of our present under- standing of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing. Go programs are very bad players, in spite of considerable eÔ¨Äort (not as much as for chess). The problem seems to be that a position in Go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction. Humans use this in chess also, but chess programs consider the position as a whole. Chess programs com- pensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or, in the case of Deep Blue, many millions of times as much computation. Sooner or later, AI research will overcome this scandalous weakness. Q. Don‚Äôt some people say that AI is a bad idea? A. The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological ma- chine being intelligent is incoherent. He proposes the Chinese room argument www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/chinese.html The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus 6 says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn‚Äôt reached human level by now, it must be impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt. Q. Aren‚Äôt computability theory and computational complexity the keys to AI? [Note to the layman and beginners in computer science: These are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science, and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical.] A. No. These theories are relevant but don‚Äôt address the fundamental problems of AI. In the 1930s mathematical logicians, especially Kurt G¬®odel and Alan Tur- ing, established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains. Whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example, and whether a poly- nomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another. Hu- mans solve problems in these domains all the time, and this has been oÔ¨Äered as an argument (usually with some decorations) that computers are intrinsi- cally incapable of doing what people do. Roger Penrose claims this. However, people can‚Äôt guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either. See my Review of The Emperor‚Äôs New Mind by Roger Penrose. More essays and reviews defending AI research are in [McC96a]. In the 1960s computer scientists, especially Steve Cook and Richard Karp developed the theory of NP-complete problem domains. Problems in these domains are solvable, but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem. Which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an NP-complete problem domain. Humans often solve problems in NP-complete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms, but can‚Äôt solve them quickly in general. What is important for AI is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems. The identification of subdomains for which good algo- rithms exist is important, but a lot of AI problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains. The theory of the diÔ¨Éculty of general classes of problems is called com- putational complexity. So far this theory hasn‚Äôt interacted with AI as much as might have been hoped. Success in problem solving by humans and by AI programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the AI community 7 have been able to identify precisely. Algorithmic complexity theory as developed by SolomonoÔ¨Ä, Kolmogorov and Chaitin (independently of one another) is also relevant. It defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it. Proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem, but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you can‚Äôt prove that the program is the shortest. 2 Branches of AI Q. What are the branches of AI? A. Here‚Äôs a list, but some branches are surely missing, because no-one has identified them yet. Some of these may be regarded as concepts or topics rather than full branches. logical AI What a program knows about the world in general the facts of the specific situation in which it must act, and its goals are all represented by sentences of some mathematical logical language. The program decides what to do by inferring that certain actions are ap- propriate for achieving its goals. The first article proposing this was [McC59]. [McC89] is a more recent summary. [McC96b] lists some of the concepts involved in logical aI. [Sha97] is an important text. search AI programs often examine large numbers of possibilities, e.g. moves in a chess game or inferences by a theorem proving program. Discover- ies are continually made about how to do this more eÔ¨Éciently in various domains. pattern recognition When a program makes observations of some kind, it is often programmed to compare what it sees with a pattern. For example, a vision program may try to match a pattern of eyes and a nose in a scene in order to find a face. More complex patterns, e.g. in a natural language text, in a chess position, or in the history of some event are also studied. These more complex patterns require quite diÔ¨Äerent methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied the most. 8 representation Facts about the world have to be represented in some way. Usually languages of mathematical logic are used. inference From some facts, others can be inferred. Mathematical logical deduction is adequate for some purposes, but new methods of non- monotonic inference have been added to logic since the 1970s. The simplest kind of non-monotonic reasoning is default reasoning in which a conclusion is to be inferred by default, but the conclusion can be withdrawn if there is evidence to the contrary. For example, when we hear of a bird, we man infer that it can fly, but this conclusion can be reversed when we hear that it is a penguin. It is the possibil- ity that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that constitutes the non-monotonic character of the reasoning. Ordinary logical reasoning is monotonic in that the set of conclusions that can the drawn from a set of premises is a monotonic increasing function of the premises. Circumscription is another form of non-monotonic reasoning. common sense knowledge and reasoning This is the area in which AI is farthest from human-level, in spite of the fact that it has been an active research area since the 1950s. While there has been considerable progress, e.g. in developing systems of non-monotonic reasoning and theories of action, yet more new ideas are needed. The Cyc system contains a large but spotty collection of common sense facts. learning from experience Programs do that. The approaches to AI based on connectionism and neural nets specialize in that. There is also learn- ing of laws expressed in logic. [Mit97] is a comprehensive undergrad- uate text on machine learning. Programs can only learn what facts or behaviors their formalisms can represent, and unfortunately learn- ing systems are almost all based on very limited abilities to represent information. planning Planning programs start with general facts about the world (es- pecially facts about the eÔ¨Äects of actions), facts about the particular situation and a statement of a goal. From these, they generate a strat- egy for achieving the goal. In the most common cases, the strategy is just a sequence of actions. epistemology This is a study of the kinds of knowledge that are required for solving problems in the world. 9 ontology Ontology is the study of the kinds of things that exist. In AI, the programs and sentences deal with various kinds of objects, and we study what these kinds are and what their basic properties are. Emphasis on ontology begins in the 1990s. heuristics A heuristic is a way of trying to discover something or an idea imbedded in a program. The term is used variously in AI. Heuristic functions are used in some approaches to search to measure how far a node in a search tree seems to be from a goal. Heuristic predicates that compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than the other, i.e. constitutes an advance toward the goal, may be more useful. [My opinion]. genetic programming Genetic programming is a technique for getting pro- grams to solve a task by mating random Lisp programs and selecting fittest in millions of generations. It is being developed by John Koza‚Äôs group and here‚Äôs a tutorial1 . 3 Applications of AI Q. What are the applications of AI? A. Here are some. game playing You can buy machines that can play master level chess for a few hundred dollars. There is some AI in them, but they play well against people mainly through brute force computation‚Äîlooking at hundreds of thousands of positions. To beat a world champion by brute force and known reliable heuristics requires being able to look at 200 million positions per second. speech recognition In the 1990s, computer speech recognition reached a practical level for limited purposes. Thus United Airlines has replaced its keyboard tree for flight information by a system using speech recog- nition of flight numbers and city names. It is quite convenient. On the the other hand, while it is possible to instruct some computers using speech, most users have gone back to the keyboard and the mouse as still more convenient. 1http://www.genetic-programming.com/gpanimatedtutorial.html 10 understanding natural language Just getting a sequence of words into a computer is not enough. Parsing sentences is not enough either. The computer has to be provided with an understanding of the domain the text is about, and this is presently possible only for very limited domains. computer vision The world is composed of three-dimensional objects, but the inputs to the human eye and computers‚Äô TV cameras are two di- mensional. Some useful programs can work solely in two dimensions, but full computer vision requires partial three-dimensional informa- tion that is not just a set of two-dimensional views. At present there are only limited ways of representing three-dimensional information di- rectly, and they are not as good as what humans evidently use. expert systems A ‚Äúknowledge engineer‚Äù interviews experts in a certain do- main and tries to embody their knowledge in a computer program for carrying out some task. How well this works depends on whether the intellectual mechanisms required for the task are within the present state of AI. When this turned out not to be so, there were many dis- appointing results. One of the first expert systems was MYCIN in 1974, which diagnosed bacterial infections of the blood and suggested treatments. It did better than medical students or practicing doctors, provided its limitations were observed. Namely, its ontology included bacteria, symptoms, and treatments and did not include patients, doc- tors, hospitals, death, recovery, and events occurring in time. Its in- teractions depended on a single patient being considered. Since the experts consulted by the knowledge engineers knew about patients, doctors, death, recovery, etc., it is clear that the knowledge engineers forced what the experts told them into a predetermined framework. In the present state of AI, this has to be true. The usefulness of current expert systems depends on their users having common sense. heuristic classification One of the most feasible kinds of expert system given the present knowledge of AI is to put some information in one of a fixed set of categories using several sources of information. An example is advising whether to accept a proposed credit card purchase. Information is available about the owner of the credit card, his record of payment and also about the item he is buying and about the estab- lishment from which he is buying it (e.g., about whether there have 11 been previous credit card frauds at this establishment). 4 More questions Q. How is AI research done? A. AI research has both theoretical and experimental sides. The experi- mental side has both basic and applied aspects. There are two main lines of research. One is biological, based on the idea that since humans are intelligent, AI should study humans and imitate their psychology or physiology. The other is phenomenal, based on studying and formalizing common sense facts about the world and the problems that the world presents to the achievement of goals. The two approaches interact to some extent, and both should eventually succeed. It is a race, but both racers seem to be walking. Q. What are the relations between AI and philosophy? A. AI has many relations with philosophy, especially modern analytic philosophy. Both study mind, and both study common sense. The best reference is [Tho03]. Q. How are AI and logic programming related? A. At the very least, logic programming provides useful programming languages (mainly Prolog). Beyond that, sometimes a theory T useful in AI can be expressed as a col- lection H of Horn clauses, and goal G to be achieved can be expressed as that of finding values of variables x1 . . . xn satisfying an expression g(x1 . . . xn). The problem can sometimes be solved by running the Prolog program con- sisting of G and H. There are two possible obstacles to regarding AI as logic programming. First, Horn theories do not exhaust first order logic. Second, the Prolog program expressing the theory may be extremely ineÔ¨Écient. More elaborate control than just executing the program that expresses the theory is often needed. Map coloring provides examples. Q. What should I study before or while learning AI? A. Study mathematics, especially mathematical logic. The more you learn about sciences, e.g. physics or biology, the better. For the biological approaches to AI, study psychology and the physiology of the nervous system. Learn some programming languages‚Äîat least C, Lisp and Prolog. It is also a good idea to learn one basic machine language. Jobs are likely to depend on 12 knowing the languages currently in fashion. In the late 1990s, these include C++ and Java. Q. What is a good textbook on AI? A. Artificial Intelligence by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Prentice Hall is the most commonly used textbbook in 1997. The general views expressed there do not exactly correspond to those of this essay. Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis by Nils Nilsson, Morgan Kaufman, may be easier to read. Some people prefer Computational Intelligence by David Poole, Alan Mack- worth and Randy Goebel, Oxford, 1998. Q. What organizations and publications are concerned with AI? A. The American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)2, the Eu- ropean Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI)3 and the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behavior (AISB)4 are scientific societies concerned with AI research. The Association for Comput- ing Machinery (ACM) has a special interest group on artificial intelligence SIGART5 . The International Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI)6 is the main inter- national conference. The AAAI7 runs a US National Conference on AI. Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence8 , Artificial Intelligence9 , and Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research10, and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence11 are four of the main journals publishing AI research papers. I have not yet found everything that should be in this paragraph. Page of Positive Reviews12 lists papers that experts have found impor- tant.

John McCarthy's article provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) for the general public. Here are the key points:

1. **Definition of AI**: AI is the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines and computer programs. It aims to understand and replicate human intelligence without being limited to biologically observable methods.

2. **Understanding Intelligence**: Intelligence involves various computational mechanisms, and AI research has successfully replicated some of these in computers. Intelligence cannot be defined with a single criterion, and AI does not solely focus on simulating human intelligence.

3. **AI Research**: The field began post-WWII, with significant contributions from figures like Alan Turing. It explores making machines perform intelligently through programming rather than hardware innovations alone.

4. **Human-Level Intelligence**: While AI aims to achieve human-level abilities, new ideas are needed beyond current programming methods for this level of intelligence.

5. **Branches of AI**: Includes logical reasoning, search methods, pattern recognition, representation of knowledge, inference, common-sense knowledge, learning, planning, and others.

6. **Applications**: AI applications range from game playing and speech recognition to expert systems and natural language understanding.

The text elaborates on various philosophical, technical, and historical aspects of AI research, emphasizing the necessity for innovative approaches to reach advanced AI capabilities."
