Introduction For decades, there have been significant labor issues around the use of technology in higher education.1 Now, however, the uncritical adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) poses a threat to academic professions through potential work intensification and job losses and through its implications for intellectual property, economic security, and the faculty working conditions that affect student learning conditions. In its 2023 Statement on Online Education, the AAUP reaffirmed its principles with regard to the use of technology in higher education, stating that “(1) the use of new technologies in teaching should be for the purpose of advancing the basic functions of colleges and univer- sities to preserve, augment, and transmit knowledge and to foster the abilities of students to learn and (2) as with all other curricular matters, the faculty should have primary responsibility for determining the policies and practices of the institution with regard to online education.”2 The findings of our survey of AAUP members, discussed in this report, show that many institutions diverge from these principles and that most faculty members have little input into how 1.

In their survey responses, AAUP members pleaded for guidance on how to deal with the onslaught of AI in their profes- sional lives. Addressing their concerns, we articulate how academic communities can intervene meaning- fully in response to issues related to AI and ed-tech in general, because they both promise to become far more entrenched in higher education in the coming years.3 Over the past two decades, colleges and universities have increasingly used ed-tech to implement learning management systems, offer online courses, and store and analyze large and small research datasets.4 At present, legacy ed-tech platforms for course manage- ment and videoconferencing often incorporate massive data collection and analyses with predictive analytics that are similar to AI. Both new and legacy platforms alike use a number of techniques, including AI and related statistical methods applied to large language models and used to analyze, make predictions and 3.

AI is both a marketing term and a usable product. Management in higher education and other sectors, the press, and technology companies often frame AI as something new, opaque, and exceedingly power- ful that will replace many activities based on human intelligence, including labor. At the same time, they encourage public buy-in and network effects—that is, gains in the value of the technology as more people use it. Such framing serves to increase the power of technology firms and employers, thereby shutting down already meager avenues for critique, dissent, negotiation, and refusal. After decades of funding cuts, many colleges and universities rely on data-intensive technologies for the triage of limited resources. These technolo- gies increasingly use AI to guide decision-making on everything from fundraising to pedagogy.5 At many institutions, faculty members are expected to take on more advising, teach more students, and conduct more research—and to manage all these responsibilities with fewer resources. But rather than addressing inequity among faculty members or improving their working conditions, which are student learning conditions, administrations often choose to invest in technological interventions that they perceive as cheaper. Technological interventions, especially those offered as one-size-fits-all solutions for educational problems, do not improve student, faculty, institu- tional, or research outcomes.6 In many instances, their use harms students as well as faculty members and staff.7 Adding to these harms, faculty members, gradu- 5.

According to the principles set forth in the AAUP’s 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, it is “the responsibility primarily of the faculty to determine the appropriate curriculum and procedures of student instruction.”8 This responsi- bility includes AI and other ed-tech infrastructure. However, many colleges and universities currently have no meaningful shared governance mechanisms around technology, as the findings of this survey suggest, and the explosion of AI has highlighted the need for such mechanisms among faculty members at individual institutions and across the higher education workforce. Methodology To gain a better understanding of how AAUP mem- bers are experiencing AI and other ed-tech and what types of concerns they might have, the committee administered the national AAUP Survey on AI and the Profession in December 2024. The survey included Likert-scale items, which were ordered to measure respondents’ attitudes, such as agreement or impor- tance, about the role of technology in higher education and at their institutions; yes-or-no items measuring whether particular tools, initiatives, or policies were in place at their institutions; and open-ended items addressing those tools, initiatives, and policies as well as general concerns regarding the use of technology in higher education. Participants were AAUP members. Five thousand members were selected from the Association’s active membership list using a random number generator and invited to participate in the online survey through a series of three email messages that provided a survey link. Approximately five hundred responses were received in two weeks and are reflected in the analysis below. Follow-up interviews were conducted in spring 2025 with thirteen respondents; however, findings from these interviews are excluded from this report. Responses collected from the Likert-scale items were analyzed and are reported at the descriptive 8. AAUP, Policy Documents and Reports, 12th ed. (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2025), 120. 3 Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions level only (including frequencies and percentages). The open-ended items were analyzed using an open-coding process identifying generalized thematic trends. The categorical results reported in this document mainly reflect the trends emerging from the preconceptualized quantitative survey items. In some cases, the report’s presentation of survey results intersperses specific anonymous quotes pertaining to descriptive frequencies and percentages to add voice to participant perspectives conveyed in the report. Overall, the results reflect the views of the faculty members and other academic work- ers who took the time to respond to the online survey, but it does not necessarily represent the views of the entire AAUP membership or the overall population of academic workers in US higher education. Findings The findings below are organized around five key con- cerns, along with recommendations related to those concerns. 1. Improving Professional Development Regarding AI and Technology Harms Despite the widespread use of ed-tech, there is an overall lack of understanding about the relationship between AI and commonly used data-intensive educa- tional technologies. Respondents viewed AI as having the potential to harm or to worsen many aspects of their work, while ed-tech is at least “somewhat helpful.” Eighty-one percent of respondents noted that they use some type of ed-tech, and 45 percent said they see it as at least somewhat helpful. Fifteen percent said they are required to use AI, yet nearly 81 percent reported that they are mandated to use ed-tech systems like the Canvas learning management system (LMS) or Google Suite, which have components that include predictive analytics, even when AI is “turned off.” This sug- gests that many faculty members and other academic workers may not realize that they are using AI-enabled tools for their work. Six percent said that they are required to use AI services like the Turnitin plagiarism detector and viewed Canvas as a data-intensive tool that is synonymous with AI. Recommendation 1: Colleges and universities should offer better and more critically informed, holistic professional development around AI, including what it is and is not and how it has been incorporated already into ed-tech business models (for example, not all users of the Canvas LMS recognize that its “Intelligent Insights” use AI and data analytics–driven recommen- dations, regardless of whether faculty members plan lessons using the Khan Academy’s Khanmigo “teacher tools” add-on). Recommendation 2: There is a need for discussions in academic communities that acknowledge technol- ogy as a labor concern and connect it with concerns around AI infrastructure and use in other sectors while underscoring the public service mission of higher education. Recommendation 3: While administrators set up “initiatives,” they are not doing enough to respond to day-to-day concerns; faculty members and other academic workers need localized policy solutions, including opportunities to directly participate in the development of best practices or guardrails that address deteriorating working and learning conditions. Untested and unproven technologies are adopted uncritically. Respondents articulated that AI technology is untested and unreliable in sensitive scenarios and thus ques- tioned if it should be used at all. One respondent noted, “AI is not dependable enough for most sci- entific medical work. I uncover major errors. This is something that teachers and students must be made aware of.” Another highlighted how generative AI interferes with the core goals of education and learn- ing: “Large language models like ChatGPT produce shallow, unoriginal ‘predictive text-y ideas’ and I worry that my students and others will increasingly believe that that’s okay—that there’s nothing better than that to aspire to.” Recommendation: Professional development around AI should include guidance for determining whether AI is the most appropriate solution for a given prob- lem and for considering whether AI use is responsible, given its potential long-term impact on institutions and academic communities. 2. Implementing Shared Governance Policies to Promote Oversight AI integration initiatives are spearheaded by admin- istrations with little input from faculty members and 4 Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions other campus community members, including staff and students. High levels of concern arose around AI and technology procurement, deployment, and use; dehumanized relations; and poor working and learn- ing conditions. Seventy-one percent of respondents said decision- making and AI initiatives are overwhelmingly led by college or university administrations, and many respondents described administrators exerting great effort to introduce AI into research, teaching, policy, and professional development with little meaning- ful input from faculty members, staff, or students. Examples include the development of institutional AI tools, workshops on teaching and detecting plagia- rism, and subscribing to AI tools for students (such as Grammarly, marketed as an “AI writing partner”) without involving faculty members or students in the decision-making process. One respondent noted that “admin doesn’t seem to care about or value faculty input on this or any other topic” and hoped for “more faculty involvement in determining how AI and tech generally are used.” This finding similarly highlights the importance of implementing AI policies created by and for faculty members, staff, and students. Recommendation: Institutions should develop meaningful shared governance policies and practices around ed-tech decision-making and use, as discussed in the AAUP’s Statement on Online Education.9 A standing or ad hoc committee of faculty members, staff, and students should be elected by their respec- tive constituencies and charged with monitoring, evaluating, and reviewing ed-tech procurement processes and policy. This ed-tech oversight commit- tee should • have access to and meaningful input in all parts of the procurement and deployment process; • push for an assessment of the impact of pro- posed ed-tech tools before decisions are made about procurement; • have the ability to meaningfully challenge deci- sions about ed-tech procurement and deployment; • perform ongoing evaluations of ed-tech data flows and uses at the university and vendor levels; 9. Policy Documents and Reports, 12th ed., 245–46. • receive institutional funds allocated for these evaluations; • have meaningful levers of enforcement (for example, an agreement by the institution to rescind or abolish contracts for any ed-tech sys- tem or vendor that the committee finds harmful or unhelpful); • have the ability to suggest new ed-tech policies; • monitor accountability of administration mem- bers for protecting faculty, staff, and student data; and • act as a liaison with the broader campus com- munity. 3. Improving Working and Learning Conditions Preexisting work intensification and devaluation are the main reasons respondents give for using AI to assist with academic tasks. A quarter of respondents (25 percent) reported using AI tools or platforms to perform service, admin- istrative duties, and teaching tasks that are often undervalued aspects of academic labor. For example, some respondents said that they used generative AI to write email messages, letters of recommendation, and internal reports or memos and to review grant applica- tions and manuscripts. Respondents also reported using AI tools or platforms for detecting plagiarism and for developing course materials, which are also undervalued but time-consuming and crucial instruc- tional duties. Respondents were overwhelmingly concerned with student plagiarism made possible by generative AI. Ninety-one percent noted that they were at least some- what concerned about preventing academic dishonesty. However, one respondent wrote, “I am less concerned about the ‘honesty’ part than the ‘failure to learn’ part.” Another respondent noted, “It is now more difficult for [students] to develop their thoughts on a topic because they don’t have to spend time with it while they work through writing about it. . . . I am worried that they will never again get the chance to change their opinion as they expose themselves to ideas over the long term.” This distinction between honesty and failure to learn is critical because it highlights one of the core goals of higher education: to develop a well-informed and thoughtful citizenry. This finding suggests that there is a need for higher education to refocus on the relational aspects of edu- cation and learning, as opposed to punitive measures 5 Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions that pit already overworked faculty members against debt-burdened students. Implementing AI in higher education adds to faculty and staff workloads and exacerbates long-standing inequities. Overall, respondents said that the rollout of AI at their colleges and universities has not made their jobs any better, but it has made some aspects of their work worse. Survey results indicate that AI has generally led to at least somewhat worse outcomes for the teaching environment (according to 62 percent of respondents), pay equity (30 percent), job enthusiasm (76 percent), academic freedom (40 percent), and student success (69 percent). This finding is important because it emphasizes how the implementation of ed-tech, including AI, is connected to long-standing inequities in higher educa- tion. Required professional development on the use of AI in teaching and research adds to faculty and staff workloads—without evidence that AI improves productivity, pedagogy, or teaching and learning processes or outcomes. Indeed, AI may have negative effects on teaching and learning, especially in some pedagogical contexts. Eighty-five percent of respondents said that they were at least somewhat concerned about how ed-tech is being implemented at their institutions. When con- sidering areas that may be affected by increased use of AI in higher education, respondents resoundingly (at least 95 percent for each category) stressed the importance of protecting intellectual property rights and academic freedom, implementing meaningful opt- out policies, maintaining data privacy, improving job security and wages, preserving workplace autonomy, and supporting accessibility. One respondent remarked that “there is ample evidence for the damage done to individuals and to society by many tech products, including generative AI, but not limited to it. However, it is treated as an unqualified good in almost all circumstances and one is required to learn and use certain technologies, even when non-tech options would be better for the work- place environment, student learning, and personal quality of life.” This response suggests the need for humanizing relationships in higher education commu- nities and emphasizing that technocratic solutions (like plagiarism-detection technology) do not by themselves move us closer to caring and effective educational environments. Recommendation: Promote accountability for inter- nally developed tools or tech company partnerships by requiring tech companies and vendors to provide proof of insurance covering liabilities related to the tech- nology and to include in contracts indemnity clauses that transfer the responsibility for harms enacted (for example, data breaches or racial or socioeconomic discrimination) to the tech company or vendor. • Contracts should specify the penalties for any harms and the process for assessing and enforc- ing those penalties. • In many if not all cases the tech company or vendor should be held liable and should pay users or the institution an amount of money proportional to the harm. • Procurement should be overseen by a subcom- mittee of the earlier proposed ed-tech oversight committee with meaningful input from faculty members, staff, and students. AI raises concerns about bias, discrimination, and accessibility because of its untested and uneven impacts on students and student learning. Data-intensive technologies have a high likelihood of making recommendations, predictions, and analyses that are biased against historically marginalized people because the data and infrastructures these technologies use is also biased.10 Ninety-eight percent of respon- dents said that supporting accessibility was ranked as at least somewhat important when considering the increased use of AI in higher education. This finding is a reminder that student and faculty access to technol- ogy and learning experiences and ease of use should be core goals of any technologies introduced. However, many respondents also cautioned that these technolo- gies can be so harmful that they should be subjected to thorough review. One respondent flatly charged that AI technology “has become a tool of surveillance by administration.” Recommendation 1: Require administrations to provide clear statements about how technology 10. See Paris, Reynolds, and McGowan, “Sins of Omission”; Bird, Castelman, Song, and Mabel, “Big Data on Campus”; Joy Buolamwini, Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What Is Human in a World of Machines (Random House, 2023); and Safiya Noble, Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism (New York Univer- sity Press, 2018). 6 Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions monitoring fits within the scope of administrators’ work, including specifics on why it is necessary, what this monitoring entails, and what outcomes may result for those monitored. • If monitoring faculty members, staff, or students is proven to be necessary for some educational reason—for example, when an instructor pro- vides assessments on submitted student work using an LMS such as Canvas—any monitoring by the LMS or the institution must not continue indefinitely and should occur only within the framework necessary for a specified task. • The administration is prohibited from using electronic monitoring that results in violation of labor and employment laws; records work- ers off-duty or in sensitive areas; uses high-risk technologies, such as facial recognition; or identifies workers exercising their rights under employment and labor law. • Administrations that electronically monitor employees to assess their performance are required to disclose performance standards to faculty members and staff and apply these stan- dards consistently. • An outside technology governance body should review and document productivity-monitoring and systems for setting performance quotas prior to their use. • Faculty members, staff, and students should be allowed to opt in to and out of monitoring of particular sessions. • Communications made available through any electronic dataset or system are protected under the same principles of academic freedom as print and other traditional media. As discussed in the AAUP’s report Academic Freedom and Electronic Communications, initially published in 1997 and last revised in 2013, this protec- tion applies to email communications, websites, online bulletin boards, LMS content, blogs, list- servs, and social media—as well as to classroom recordings or videoconferencing communication on platforms such as Zoom.11 Recommendation 2: Minimize harms and bias result- ing from the use of AI. 11. AAUP, “Academic Freedom and Electronic Communications,” Policy Documents and Reports, 12th ed. (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2025), 48. • Campuses must conduct impact assessments of electronic monitoring systems, testing for bias and other harms to faculty members, staff, and students prior to use. • Technology should be accessible for the wide range of needs of faculty members, staff, and students. • Technology should be used to augment acces- sibility to the institutional working or learning environment where necessary. • All technologies used should be subject to regu- lar and ongoing accessibility audits by a group of users approved by the campus AAUP chapter or another independent body, such as the ed- tech oversight committee proposed above or a subcommittee thereof. • Institutional funds should be available for these audit activities. 4. Demanding Transparency and the Ability to Opt Out Faculty members, staff, and students lack choice and meaningful avenues to opt out of AI-based tools and other ed-tech. This finding highlights the importance of not only prioritizing the needs and well-being of faculty mem- bers, staff, and students when implementing new AI and other ed-tech systems but also establishing policies that allow them to opt out of such systems. Furthermore, the unquestioned status quo of the continued expansion of AI often forecloses possibilities to negotiate the use of AI. Recommendation 1: Create meaningful opt-out poli- cies, avoiding one-size-fits-all approaches. Faculty members, staff, and students should be able to opt out of technology use in ways that will not impose a burden on them or negatively affect their working or learning conditions. It is the prerogative of educators to determine the best pedagogy in a given context and to decide whether AI engagement in learning is detrimental or simply inappropriate in some cases. Faculty members should be able to opt out of assessments that use AI or other ed-tech tools in classrooms and online or to require the use of other modalities to assess students’ performance, understanding, and knowledge. Institutions should allow different constituents to explore and establish best practices and protections most appropriate to specific contexts and applications. 7 Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions Recommendation 2: Protect intellectual property for instructional materials. Standards should be set for how instructional mate- rials may or may not be used in AI and other ed-tech data streams, including LMS platforms such as Canvas. While course syllabi are considered public documents at some colleges and universities, instructional materi- als such as lectures and original audiovisual materials constitute faculty intellectual property.12 As discussed in the AAUP’s Statement on Online Education, these prin- ciples apply to courses taught in person, online, or in a hybrid format. These principles also apply to AI and ed-tech generally, meaning that instructional materials, like other works of scholarship, must not be incorpo- rated into AI data streams—for example, AI training datasets—without the consent of the creator.13 Recommendation 3: Protect student and instructor privacy. Data, content, and information collected in AI and other ed-tech data streams should not be the property of the institution or vendors unless they identify and clearly disclose to faculty, students, and administrators a specific educational need. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a US federal law that protects the privacy of student education records, is a floor and not a ceiling for considering whether data-intensive technologies should be procured and used in a higher education setting.14 Faculty members, staff, and students should be allowed to opt out of having their data, content, or information used or shared at no penalty to them or to their working or learning conditions. Few institutions have created transparent, equitable policies or provided effective professional develop- ment opportunities on AI use. Respondents noted the need for transparent and equitable policies on AI in their reflections on what they would change about the use of technology in 12.

Jones and Amy VanScoy, “The Syllabus as a Student Privacy Document in an Age of Learning Analytics,” Journal of Documentation 75, no. 6 (January 1, 2019): 1333–55, https://doi. org/10.1108/JD-12-2018-0202; Elana Zeide, “The Limits of Education Purpose Limitations,” University of Miami Law Review 71, no. 2 (March 1, 2017): 494; and Paris, Reynolds, and McGowan, “Sins of Omission.” higher education. One respondent emphasized the importance of “fair and equitable policies with clear transparency” for faculty members and students to better understand the acceptable uses of AI. Address- ing student use of AI, another respondent noted that “strategies, resources, and training would be really helpful in navigating this challenge.” Although 90 percent of respondents reported that their colleges and universities have introduced initiatives around uses of AI for teaching, research, learning, or work, these initiatives have not materi- alized into clear policies on AI implementation and use. This finding aligns with Inside Higher Ed’s 2024 Survey of College and University Chief Academic Officers, which found that 20 percent of colleges and universities have published a policy or policies govern- ing the use of AI, including teaching and research.15 The lack of transparent and equitable policies seems at odds with the cross-campus AI initiatives, work- shops, and expenditures spearheaded by college and university administrations and described by some respondents in terms such as “enormous,” highlighting again how faculty members, staff, and students are left out of major decisions about technology implementa- tion and use. In open-ended responses, survey takers asked for better policies and more rigorous enforce- ment and accountability around technology in higher education. Some argued for guardrails, resources, and recommendations for ethical AI use, while others argued for prohibiting use in certain scenarios. Faculty members and staff need to have input in eval- uating ed-tech before deployment, to have a say in how that technology is deployed and used, and to participate in ongoing evaluation of the technology and related policy over time. Ongoing communication, professional development, and cultivation of transparency with faculty members and staff will be important. Meaningful shared governance policies and practices should include access to information about the procurement and deploy- ment process and the ability to meaningfully challenge administrations’ decision-making facilitated by data- intensive technology, as discussed earlier. Recommendation 1: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities. Faculty members, other academic workers, and 15. “2024 Survey of College and University Chief Academic Officers,” Inside Higher Ed, https://www.insidehighered.com/reports /2024/04/15/2024-survey-college-and-university-chief-academic-officers. 8 Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions students should have access to ongoing professional development—approved by the ed-tech oversight com- mittee described above and organized and paid for by the institution—about technology uses, harms, and benefits. Recommendation 2: Ensure transparency and disclo- sure in ed-tech and the use of data streams. Faculty members and other academic workers should have • access to institutional technology procurement practices; • transparency regarding the cost of technologies procured and any alternatives; • access to contracts with vendors; • access to data collected about them through ed- tech platforms or electronic monitoring systems; • the right to correct any data collected about them and to hold administrations accountable for adjusting any appointment-related decisions that were based, partially or solely, on inaccurate or biased data; • access to names of “partner companies” and vendors and clear articulations of how they use data streams; and • protection from retaliation for exercising their rights, including private rights of action. 5. Protecting Faculty Members and Other Academic Workers Academic workers across job categories are worried about increased reliance on contingent appointments and declining wages. Respondents expressed concern about academic freedom and intellectual property rights. Eighty-seven percent of respondents maintained that it is important to improve job security and wages as AI is rolled out. Among part-time faculty members, there was near unanimity on this issue. Similarly, many respondents said that AI has generally led to worse outcomes for pay equity (27 percent), academic freedom (20 percent), and job enthusiasm (38 percent) at their institutions. Part-time faculty members and librarians were nearly unanimous that AI was lead- ing to worse outcomes in most areas. Eighty-seven percent of respondents said that it is at least somewhat important to protect intellectual property rights over the products of their academic work. The path of dehumanization and automation is not the only option available. The growing adoption of data-intensive technologies in the workplace repre- sents a critical challenge for workers across industries and job categories, highlighting the urgent need for a new set of labor standards for technology in higher education. These standards must be bold and compre- hensive, keeping pace with the rapid advancements in workplace technologies and addressing the potential risks they pose to faculty members, staff, students, and society more broadly. Academic workers are intimately familiar with the benefits, shortcomings, and harms of the technologies they use. Their engagement with technology offers insights that can drive meaningful change. It is impor- tant for faculty members and staff to participate actively in deciding which technologies are implemented, how they are used in their workplaces, and how result- ing productivity gains are shared among all campus community members. Campuses can establish higher education workplace policies to harness new technolo- gies and prioritize living-wage jobs, good working conditions that contribute to good learning conditions, and equity across job and identity categories. Recommendation 1: Maintain protections against work intensification. Members of the institution’s ed-tech oversight com- mittee should identify issues of work intensification, such as plagiarism checking, as well as invisible labor—unseen and often uncompensated tasks and responsibilities that are essential but frequently overlooked—related to technology implementation. Any technology found by the committee to be meaningfully causing work intensification should be prohibited or curtailed, and the committee should propose “best practices” to minimize work intensification. Recommendation 2: Provide protections against deskilling and job loss. Decisions on faculty appointments such as hiring, tenure, promotion, or termination should not rely pri- marily or exclusively on AI or data-intensive analytic technologies. Instead, decision-makers must indepen- dently corroborate the findings and data and provide the faculty member with full documentation, including the actual data used. • Data-intensive technologies cannot be used as a pretext for shifting faculty members holding tenure-line appointments to contingent appoint- ments or lower-paid positions. • Data-intensive technologies cannot be used to justify decreasing wages in any way. 9 Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions • Data and information from these technologies cannot be the basis for decisions on faculty appointments such as hiring, reappointment, tenure, promotion, or termination. • If any of the above scenarios occur, a hearing and audit should be held to evaluate the tech- nology and consider prohibiting it. Recommendation 3: Implement processes that allow faculty members and staff to meaningfully challenge administrative decisions on ed-tech. There should be ongoing review of, and faculty participation in, decision-making. If reviews find that any technology contributes to deskilling, wage decreases, or job loss or to decreased academic freedom, intellectual property rights, faculty involve- ment in shared governance, or rights to organize for protections, there should be a process for faculty members and staff to meaningfully challenge the use of the offending technology and to reconsider, downsize, renegotiate, or void the contract for that technology. Any technology that threatens the academic free- dom, role in shared governance, or economic security of faculty members should be prohibited. Recommendation 4: Protect academic freedom and the right to organize. Fundamental principles of academic freedom apply as much to AI and other ed-tech data streams as they do to electronic communications in general, including commu- nications among faculty members about their working conditions and organizing on their own behalf.16 Strategy, Targets, Outputs, and Action The survey findings presented in this report highlight the need to establish structures of bottom-up shared governance to guide decisions around ed-tech, and especially AI, in higher education. The report also points to the importance of fostering solidaristic strat- egies across higher education, education more broadly, white-collar and industrial sectors, and civil society and grassroots organizations fighting on many fronts to establish bottom-up policy around generative AI. Internal and External Organizing Targets: AAUP members and the broader higher edu- cation community 16. See AAUP, “Academic Freedom and Electronic Communica- tions,” Policy Documents and Reports, 12th ed., 48–63. There is a lot of work to do to communicate the poten- tial harms related to uncritical deployment of AI and other ed-tech. Academic work and the learning condi- tions of students—and indeed higher education more broadly—are often devalued by technology. There is also a need to establish research functions within the AAUP that facilitate collaboration across associations and unions in higher education and other sectors. Together, these organizations could provide evolving best practices, guidelines, collective bargaining wish lists, ed-tech profes- sional development, and organizing support as well as guidance on individual institutional issues. External communication strategies: • Organize and conduct workshops and develop documentation for faculty members covering ed-tech procurement processes, budget foren- sics, assessment of the impact of technology, and vendor practices. • Communicate with campus community mem- bers, policymakers, and the public through op-eds, AAUP member communications, conferences, meetings, and cross-union, civil society, legislative, and public conversations. • Develop web resources promoting these initia- tives and other publicly available materials. Internal communication strategies: • Build out robust faculty, staff, and student educational resources on how technology is an issue that affects academic work, educational environments, and quality of life. • Work toward establishing faculty, staff, and stu- dent boards or governing bodies that can hold administrators accountable for their decision- making, with the goal of correcting technology policy failures to serve the educational mission of the institution. Guardrails and Best Practices Target: AAUP members Each of the conceptual recommendations above points to problems and solutions to overcome them. Building on the AFT document detailing “guardrails” for using AI in primary and secondary schools17 and the findings 17. American Federation of Teachers, “Commonsense Guardrails for Using Advanced Technology in Schools,” published June 18, 2024; updated March 2025, https://www.aft.org/press-release/aft-announces -new-guardrails-artificial-intelligence-nations-classrooms. 10 Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions and recommendations in this report, the AAUP should develop and promulgate a set of best practices for policymaking around the use of AI in higher educa- tion. In institutions without a bargaining unit, chapter members and leaders should attempt to adopt these practices through governance bodies, such as academic senates, and put in place mechanisms for enforcement and oversight. Bargaining Target: AAUP collective bargaining chapters Establish a wish list developed from the recommenda- tions in this report to be adapted by bargaining-unit legal representatives for each institutional context. As they draft demands and negotiate agreements with administrations, bargaining units should consult with any internal ed-tech committees or teams they have established. State Policy Target: State lawmakers Currently in the United States, employers are introduc- ing untested data-intensive technologies with almost no regulation or oversight, as former Federal Com- munications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler documented.18 Workers largely do not have the right to know what data are being gathered about them or whether the data are being shared with others. They do not have the right to review or correct the data. Employers in many states are not required to notify workers about any electronic monitoring or algo- rithms they are basing decisions on, and workers do not have the right to challenge those decisions. One of the most important strategies for state policy would be providing government agencies and employ- ees the skills and resources necessary to research, educate others about, enhance, and enforce these protections. There should be increases in funding at state and federal levels for that purpose. However, we know that the Trump administration is currently unin- terested in advancing such measures, as it has reversed 18.

Provide guidance by organized labor to government agencies and employees through coordinated outreach and research efforts. 11 Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions even the mildest interventions to promote thoughtful, equitable advances in AI.19 At present, even state-level interventions seem unlikely. Nonetheless, we can build momentum for future policy interventions even where it appears there is no way forward. The table above sums up this section’s suggestions about strategies, targets, output, and action. Conclusion: Next Steps for AI in Higher Education It is essential that higher education workers are in control of technological advancements affecting their employment. Faculty members and other academic workers are the closest to these technologies and are intimately familiar with their benefits, shortcomings, and harms. Their familiarity with ed-tech prom- ises invaluable insights that can drive meaningful change. Faculty members should actively participate in deciding which ed-tech systems are adopted, how they are implemented in their workplaces, and how the resulting benefits are shared among all academic workers. We can establish appropriate higher educa- tion workplace policy and use our power to harness new technologies for fostering dynamic and produc- tive institutions that prioritize economic security, good faculty working conditions and student learn- ing conditions, and equity for all campus community members, while refusing tools that undermine these aims. ■ 19.

An appar- ently apolitical choice—for example, treating all data points used to train an AI model equally —can result in models that are more accurate in regions where the density and quality of data is higher; these often coincide with the northern and western areas of the world (e.g., [1, 2]). Inequity in the access to data and computational resources exacerbates gaps between com- munities in understanding climate change impacts and acting towards mitigation and adapta- tion, often in ways that are detrimental to those who are most affected (e.g., [3, 4]). While these issues are not exclusive to AI, widespread opacity in the development and functioning of AI models, presentation of AI model outcomes, and the rapid evolution of the AI field further increase the inequality in power and agency among differently resourced parties. This creates an opportunity for climate scientists to rethink the role of ethics in their approach to research. There are many ways in which climate scientists can interact with soci- ety. Here we focus on the process of scientific research, identifying some good practices for building trustworthy and responsible models and then providing some resources. In creating and training models, we encourage researchers to recognize that science cannot claim to be purely “objective”, and that the choice of priors, data, and metrics all carry biases (e.g., [5]). Resolving or eliminating them is not realistic, as the interpretation of a “better” model or result is highly dependent on the user’s specific goal. Hence, it is crucial to be open and specific about the assumptions made, the algorithms and hyperparameters used, and the evaluation metrics and processes, and ideally to also make data and code available, following the principles of reproducible science (e.g., [6]). In evaluating and presenting the performance of statistical or machine learning models, considering possible failure modes can be a useful lens through which to examine systems’ behaviors. Good starting points are the taxonomy proposed by [7], which considers flaws in design, implementation, and communication, and, specifically for climate science, the list compiled by [8]. Failure modes that are particularly relevant for AI models from the climate domain include robustness under distribution shifts; for example, for models trained on his- torical data, it is difficult to predict how they will perform in the unseen conditions brought about by climate change. Good practices induced by consideration of failure modes may include efforts to quantify expected model performance through simulations, transparency in defining the anticipated range of applicability of the model, and considering how existing physics/climate knowledge can be applied in defining an evaluation strategy and in validating PLOS CLIMATE PLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000465 August 2, 2024 1 / 4 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Acquaviva V, Barnes EA, Gagne DJ, II, McKinley GA, Thais S (2024) Ethics in climate AI: From theory to practice.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. the generalization properties of the model. A related practice is to consider how the functional- ity lens changes and what failure modes become relevant when looking at the whole “phase space” of a model, intended as the array of different breakdowns of data, such as geographical areas, time periods, or user groups, as well as the broader socio-technical context in which a model can be used beyond the use case for which it was developed. In creating and distributing data sets, a term we use to indicate both observational data and other products such as outputs of Earth System Models, we begin by recognizing that we typi- cally don’t hold power on who will use the data and how the data will be used. We can, how- ever, aim to provide clear documentation on what dataset or numerical model creators thought of as desired and pertinent usage, as well as undesired, inappropriate, or wrong usage. Additionally, we can aim to be as transparent as possible in language and jargon in order to make climate information more widely accessible to a broad range of users and decision mak- ers; see, e.g., [9] for example of potential pitfalls when datasets are used across domains. A pos- sible pipeline to consider when creating data sets is provided by the Datasheets for Earth Science Datasets [10]. When possible, we propose to prefer AI models that are intrinsically interpretable (some- times defined as those built from pieces whose behavior is interpretable, such as decision trees or linear models) or explainable (sometimes defined as those whose behavior and decisions can be explained post hoc, for example, by means of a simpler surrogate model; see e.g., [11]). Interpretability and explainability can protect us from dangerous failure modes by creating insights into the ability of our model to generalize beyond the training domain, allowing us to check whether the explanation is consistent with our understanding of a physical system, and by allowing access to a wider and more inclusive user base, for example those who are not fully trained in or don’t have the resources to run more complex models, such as deep learning methods. However, applying explainability tools or using interpretable methods is not always possible or practical. We would like to propose a wider interpretation of explainability, which includes interrogating the system by exploring its responses to a wide range of inputs, includ- ing distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. In addition, we can perform physically informed perturbations of the system that act on the spatial, temporal or phenomenological scales of interest to assess their impact. By studying the behavior of AI systems under varied circum- stances, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding that is a proxy for explainability. An important reflection on encouraging the use of broadly-defined explainable models, as well as the need for clear documentation mentioned above, is that creating well-documented and explainable models can be a much slower process than using potentially more powerful, but black-box, methods. Generating physically meaningful features that can improve perfor- mance, implementing frameworks to enhance explainability, and writing documentation are time-consuming processes. Hence, rewarding the creation of such models requires a culture shift. Our current incen- tive structure is not built to reward this approach. Most often, the threshold for publication is set by an improvement in model performance typically measured by model accuracy on a pre- chosen data set. Furthermore, the measure of academic “success” (and in return, the chances to secure academic positions or grant funding, or to win awards) is heavily influenced by the number of papers and conference papers, creating pressure to publish more but not necessarily to curate impact. We can, however, challenge and change the status quo, by leading by example in our research, fostering a culture of explainable work in our labs, and appropriately reward- ing well-documented, explainable, robust, and broadly impactful work when evaluating papers, proposals, job applications, and nominations for awards. Besides being ethical, this culture shift in climate data science is made crucial by the fact that many private companies, including Google Deep Mind, NVIDIA, and Microsoft, are now PLOS CLIMATE PLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000465 August 2, 2024 2 / 4 racing ahead of academic centers in building complex machine learning-based climate and weather models (e.g., [12]). With very few exceptions, the computational resources available to universities won’t match those offered by tech giants, but we can and must retain the impor- tant role of creating generalizable insights and providing, with each of our papers and prod- ucts, a foundation for others to improve on our work. If we collaborate or work for these private companies, we should also remain aware of the potential for them to limit access to the information we produce. Finally, we would like to emphasize that ethical AI and science are intertwined, interdepen- dent topics. We should begin to include ethics in the climate science discourse, starting in the classroom. It is important to have these conversations in undergraduate and graduate courses and to integrate relevant resources in the climate science curricula, as well as at climate science conferences through special sessions. Starting points for such conversations include: • The lectures of the Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Science 2022 Sum- mer School [13]; • AI Ethics Education for Scientists [14]; • AI Ethics and Fundamental Physics [15]. The benefits of applying principles of ethical AI in scientific inquiry and to reward explain- ability, robustness, and trustworthiness are many: making more information available to more people, empowering communities affected by climate change, making climate research more impactful and accessible, and increasing the level of interaction and trust between climate sci- entists and society. This comes at the price of a culture shift where scientists are called to build models and data sets according to certain principles, to change the system of incentives in order to reward slower but more robust, explainable, and transparent work, and to engage in discussing and teaching the ethical aspects of climate data science as early as possible.

The opinions expressed here are not all consensus opinion among researchers in AI. 1 Basic Questions Q. What is artificial intelligence? A. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, es- pecially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. Q. Yes, but what is intelligence? A. Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines. Q. Isn’t there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn’t depend on relating it to human intelligence? 2 A. Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent. We understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others. Q. Is intelligence a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question “Is this machine intelligent or not?”? A. No. Intelligence involves mechanisms, and AI research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others. If doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today, computer pro- grams can give very impressive performances on these tasks. Such programs should be considered “somewhat intelligent”. Q. Isn’t AI about simulating human intelligence? A. Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use meth- ods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do. Q. What about IQ? Do computer programs have IQs? A. No. IQ is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children. It is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the child’s age. The scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. IQ correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life, but making computers that can score high on IQ tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness. For example, the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities, perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with at once. However, “digit span” is trivial for even extremely limited computers. However, some of the problems on IQ tests are useful challenges for AI. Q. What about other comparisons between human and computer intelli- gence? Arthur R. Jensen [Jen98], a leading researcher in human intelligence, suggests “as a heuristic hypothesis” that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that diﬀerences in intelligence are related to “quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions”. I see them as speed, short term memory, and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories. Whether or not Jensen is right about human intelligence, the situation in 3 AI today is the reverse. Computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs. Some abilities that children normally don’t develop till they are teenagers may be in, and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are. Very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for AI can usefully be diﬀerent from that in people. Whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people, this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task eﬃciently. Q. When did AI research start? A. After WWII, a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines. The English mathematician Alan Turing may have been the first. He gave a lecture on it in 1947. He also may have been the first to decide that AI was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines. By the late 1950s, there were many researchers on AI, and most of them were basing their work on programming computers. Q. Does AI aim to put the human mind into the computer? A. Some researchers say they have that objective, but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically. The human mind has a lot of peculiarities, and I’m not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them. Q. What is the Turing test? A. Alan Turing’s 1950 article Computing Machinery and Intelligence [Tur50] discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent. He argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledge- able observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent. This test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers. The observer could in- teract with the machine and a human by teletype (to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person), and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer. The Turing test is a one-sided test. A machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent, but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human. Daniel Dennett’s book Brainchildren [Den98] has an excellent discussion 4 of the Turing test and the various partial Turing tests that have been im- plemented, i.e. with restrictions on the observer’s knowledge of AI and the subject matter of questioning. It turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent. Q. Does AI aim at human-level intelligence? A. Yes. The ultimate eﬀort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans. However, many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious. Q. How far is AI from reaching human-level intelligence? When will it happen? A. A few people think that human-level intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for ex- pressing knowledge. However, most AI researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required, and therefore it cannot be predicted when human-level intelligence will be achieved. Q. Are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent? A. Computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine. Many researchers invented non-computer machines, hoping that they would be intelligent in diﬀerent ways than the computer programs could be. However, they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building. Because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster, another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine. Q. Are computers fast enough to be intelligent? A. Some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas. My own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them. Of course, quite apart from the ambitions of AI researchers, computers will keep getting faster. Q. What about parallel machines? A. Machines with many processors are much faster than single proces- sors can be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary to face this awkwardness. Q. What about making a “child machine” that could improve by reading and by learning from experience? 5 A. This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s. Even- tually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven’t yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading. Q. Might an AI system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about AI? A. I think yes, but we aren’t yet at a level of AI at which this process can begin. Q. What about chess? A. Alexander Kronrod, a Russian AI researcher, said “Chess is the Drosophila of AI.” He was making an analogy with geneticists’ use of that fruit fly to study inheritance. Playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others. Chess programs now play at grandmaster level, but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player, substituting large amounts of computation for understanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can build human-level chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs. Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making com- puters play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific do- main. It is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their eﬀorts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races. Q. What about Go? A. The Chinese and Japanese game of Go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving. Go exposes the weakness of our present under- standing of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing. Go programs are very bad players, in spite of considerable eﬀort (not as much as for chess). The problem seems to be that a position in Go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction. Humans use this in chess also, but chess programs consider the position as a whole. Chess programs com- pensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or, in the case of Deep Blue, many millions of times as much computation. Sooner or later, AI research will overcome this scandalous weakness. Q. Don’t some people say that AI is a bad idea? A. The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological ma- chine being intelligent is incoherent. He proposes the Chinese room argument www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/chinese.html The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus 6 says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn’t reached human level by now, it must be impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt. Q. Aren’t computability theory and computational complexity the keys to AI? [Note to the layman and beginners in computer science: These are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science, and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical.] A. No. These theories are relevant but don’t address the fundamental problems of AI. In the 1930s mathematical logicians, especially Kurt G¨odel and Alan Tur- ing, established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains. Whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example, and whether a poly- nomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another. Hu- mans solve problems in these domains all the time, and this has been oﬀered as an argument (usually with some decorations) that computers are intrinsi- cally incapable of doing what people do. Roger Penrose claims this. However, people can’t guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either. See my Review of The Emperor’s New Mind by Roger Penrose. More essays and reviews defending AI research are in [McC96a]. In the 1960s computer scientists, especially Steve Cook and Richard Karp developed the theory of NP-complete problem domains. Problems in these domains are solvable, but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem. Which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an NP-complete problem domain. Humans often solve problems in NP-complete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms, but can’t solve them quickly in general. What is important for AI is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems. The identification of subdomains for which good algo- rithms exist is important, but a lot of AI problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains. The theory of the diﬃculty of general classes of problems is called com- putational complexity. So far this theory hasn’t interacted with AI as much as might have been hoped. Success in problem solving by humans and by AI programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the AI community 7 have been able to identify precisely. Algorithmic complexity theory as developed by Solomonoﬀ, Kolmogorov and Chaitin (independently of one another) is also relevant. It defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it. Proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem, but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you can’t prove that the program is the shortest. 2 Branches of AI Q. What are the branches of AI? A. Here’s a list, but some branches are surely missing, because no-one has identified them yet. Some of these may be regarded as concepts or topics rather than full branches. logical AI What a program knows about the world in general the facts of the specific situation in which it must act, and its goals are all represented by sentences of some mathematical logical language. The program decides what to do by inferring that certain actions are ap- propriate for achieving its goals. The first article proposing this was [McC59]. [McC89] is a more recent summary. [McC96b] lists some of the concepts involved in logical aI. [Sha97] is an important text. search AI programs often examine large numbers of possibilities, e.g. moves in a chess game or inferences by a theorem proving program. Discover- ies are continually made about how to do this more eﬃciently in various domains. pattern recognition When a program makes observations of some kind, it is often programmed to compare what it sees with a pattern. For example, a vision program may try to match a pattern of eyes and a nose in a scene in order to find a face. More complex patterns, e.g. in a natural language text, in a chess position, or in the history of some event are also studied. These more complex patterns require quite diﬀerent methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied the most. 8 representation Facts about the world have to be represented in some way. Usually languages of mathematical logic are used. inference From some facts, others can be inferred. Mathematical logical deduction is adequate for some purposes, but new methods of non- monotonic inference have been added to logic since the 1970s. The simplest kind of non-monotonic reasoning is default reasoning in which a conclusion is to be inferred by default, but the conclusion can be withdrawn if there is evidence to the contrary. For example, when we hear of a bird, we man infer that it can fly, but this conclusion can be reversed when we hear that it is a penguin. It is the possibil- ity that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that constitutes the non-monotonic character of the reasoning. Ordinary logical reasoning is monotonic in that the set of conclusions that can the drawn from a set of premises is a monotonic increasing function of the premises. Circumscription is another form of non-monotonic reasoning. common sense knowledge and reasoning This is the area in which AI is farthest from human-level, in spite of the fact that it has been an active research area since the 1950s. While there has been considerable progress, e.g. in developing systems of non-monotonic reasoning and theories of action, yet more new ideas are needed. The Cyc system contains a large but spotty collection of common sense facts. learning from experience Programs do that. The approaches to AI based on connectionism and neural nets specialize in that. There is also learn- ing of laws expressed in logic. [Mit97] is a comprehensive undergrad- uate text on machine learning. Programs can only learn what facts or behaviors their formalisms can represent, and unfortunately learn- ing systems are almost all based on very limited abilities to represent information. planning Planning programs start with general facts about the world (es- pecially facts about the eﬀects of actions), facts about the particular situation and a statement of a goal. From these, they generate a strat- egy for achieving the goal. In the most common cases, the strategy is just a sequence of actions. epistemology This is a study of the kinds of knowledge that are required for solving problems in the world. 9 ontology Ontology is the study of the kinds of things that exist. In AI, the programs and sentences deal with various kinds of objects, and we study what these kinds are and what their basic properties are. Emphasis on ontology begins in the 1990s. heuristics A heuristic is a way of trying to discover something or an idea imbedded in a program. The term is used variously in AI. Heuristic functions are used in some approaches to search to measure how far a node in a search tree seems to be from a goal. Heuristic predicates that compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than the other, i.e. constitutes an advance toward the goal, may be more useful. [My opinion]. genetic programming Genetic programming is a technique for getting pro- grams to solve a task by mating random Lisp programs and selecting fittest in millions of generations. It is being developed by John Koza’s group and here’s a tutorial1 . 3 Applications of AI Q. What are the applications of AI? A. Here are some. game playing You can buy machines that can play master level chess for a few hundred dollars. There is some AI in them, but they play well against people mainly through brute force computation—looking at hundreds of thousands of positions. To beat a world champion by brute force and known reliable heuristics requires being able to look at 200 million positions per second. speech recognition In the 1990s, computer speech recognition reached a practical level for limited purposes. Thus United Airlines has replaced its keyboard tree for flight information by a system using speech recog- nition of flight numbers and city names. It is quite convenient. On the the other hand, while it is possible to instruct some computers using speech, most users have gone back to the keyboard and the mouse as still more convenient. 1http://www.genetic-programming.com/gpanimatedtutorial.html 10 understanding natural language Just getting a sequence of words into a computer is not enough. Parsing sentences is not enough either. The computer has to be provided with an understanding of the domain the text is about, and this is presently possible only for very limited domains. computer vision The world is composed of three-dimensional objects, but the inputs to the human eye and computers’ TV cameras are two di- mensional. Some useful programs can work solely in two dimensions, but full computer vision requires partial three-dimensional informa- tion that is not just a set of two-dimensional views. At present there are only limited ways of representing three-dimensional information di- rectly, and they are not as good as what humans evidently use. expert systems A “knowledge engineer” interviews experts in a certain do- main and tries to embody their knowledge in a computer program for carrying out some task. How well this works depends on whether the intellectual mechanisms required for the task are within the present state of AI. When this turned out not to be so, there were many dis- appointing results. One of the first expert systems was MYCIN in 1974, which diagnosed bacterial infections of the blood and suggested treatments. It did better than medical students or practicing doctors, provided its limitations were observed. Namely, its ontology included bacteria, symptoms, and treatments and did not include patients, doc- tors, hospitals, death, recovery, and events occurring in time. Its in- teractions depended on a single patient being considered. Since the experts consulted by the knowledge engineers knew about patients, doctors, death, recovery, etc., it is clear that the knowledge engineers forced what the experts told them into a predetermined framework. In the present state of AI, this has to be true. The usefulness of current expert systems depends on their users having common sense. heuristic classification One of the most feasible kinds of expert system given the present knowledge of AI is to put some information in one of a fixed set of categories using several sources of information. An example is advising whether to accept a proposed credit card purchase. Information is available about the owner of the credit card, his record of payment and also about the item he is buying and about the estab- lishment from which he is buying it (e.g., about whether there have 11 been previous credit card frauds at this establishment). 4 More questions Q. How is AI research done? A. AI research has both theoretical and experimental sides. The experi- mental side has both basic and applied aspects. There are two main lines of research. One is biological, based on the idea that since humans are intelligent, AI should study humans and imitate their psychology or physiology. The other is phenomenal, based on studying and formalizing common sense facts about the world and the problems that the world presents to the achievement of goals. The two approaches interact to some extent, and both should eventually succeed. It is a race, but both racers seem to be walking. Q. What are the relations between AI and philosophy? A. AI has many relations with philosophy, especially modern analytic philosophy. Both study mind, and both study common sense. The best reference is [Tho03]. Q. How are AI and logic programming related? A. At the very least, logic programming provides useful programming languages (mainly Prolog). Beyond that, sometimes a theory T useful in AI can be expressed as a col- lection H of Horn clauses, and goal G to be achieved can be expressed as that of finding values of variables x1 . . . xn satisfying an expression g(x1 . . . xn). The problem can sometimes be solved by running the Prolog program con- sisting of G and H. There are two possible obstacles to regarding AI as logic programming. First, Horn theories do not exhaust first order logic. Second, the Prolog program expressing the theory may be extremely ineﬃcient. More elaborate control than just executing the program that expresses the theory is often needed. Map coloring provides examples. Q. What should I study before or while learning AI? A. Study mathematics, especially mathematical logic. The more you learn about sciences, e.g. physics or biology, the better. For the biological approaches to AI, study psychology and the physiology of the nervous system. Learn some programming languages—at least C, Lisp and Prolog. It is also a good idea to learn one basic machine language. Jobs are likely to depend on 12 knowing the languages currently in fashion. In the late 1990s, these include C++ and Java. Q. What is a good textbook on AI? A. Artificial Intelligence by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Prentice Hall is the most commonly used textbbook in 1997. The general views expressed there do not exactly correspond to those of this essay. Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis by Nils Nilsson, Morgan Kaufman, may be easier to read. Some people prefer Computational Intelligence by David Poole, Alan Mack- worth and Randy Goebel, Oxford, 1998. Q. What organizations and publications are concerned with AI? A. The American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)2, the Eu- ropean Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI)3 and the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behavior (AISB)4 are scientific societies concerned with AI research. The Association for Comput- ing Machinery (ACM) has a special interest group on artificial intelligence SIGART5 . The International Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI)6 is the main inter- national conference. The AAAI7 runs a US National Conference on AI. Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence8 , Artificial Intelligence9 , and Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research10, and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence11 are four of the main journals publishing AI research papers.

This document provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) for a general audience, highlighting that opinions within are not universally held among AI researchers.

### Key Questions Addressed:

- **What is AI?**  
  AI is the science of creating intelligent machines, primarily through computer programs. It is linked to understanding human intelligence, though it isn't limited to mimicking biologically observed methods.

- **What is intelligence?**  
  Defined as the computational ability to achieve goals, intelligence varies across humans, animals, and some machines.

- **AI's Relation to Human Intelligence:**  
  AI is not restricted to human-like methods; it focuses more on problem-solving. AI doesn't aim to replicate the human mind with all its complexities.

- **The Turing Test:**  
  Proposed by Alan Turing, it evaluates a machine's intelligence based on its ability to imitate human interaction convincingly.

- **Human-Level Intelligence in AI:**  
  The ultimate goal is achieving human-level intelligence, though this requires new ideas, making predictions difficult.

- **Parallel and Child Machines:**  
  Parallel machines offer speed but are programming-complex. The concept of a ""child machine"" that learns and improves remains a future goal.

### Branches of AI:

1. **Logical AI:** Uses mathematical logic for decision-making.
2. **Search and Pattern Recognition:** Focus on efficient search in vast possibilities and pattern matching.
3. **Representation and Inference:** Methods of representing world knowledge and logical deduction.
4. **Learning, Planning, and Common Sense Reasoning:** From machine learning to strategic planning and reasoning based on common sense.

An appar- ently apolitical choice—for example, treating all data points used to train an AI model equally —can result in models that are more accurate in regions where the density and quality of data is higher; these often coincide with the northern and western areas of the world (e.g., [1, 2]). Inequity in the access to data and computational resources exacerbates gaps between com- munities in understanding climate change impacts and acting towards mitigation and adapta- tion, often in ways that are detrimental to those who are most affected (e.g., [3, 4]). While these issues are not exclusive to AI, widespread opacity in the development and functioning of AI models, presentation of AI model outcomes, and the rapid evolution of the AI field further increase the inequality in power and agency among differently resourced parties. This creates an opportunity for climate scientists to rethink the role of ethics in their approach to research. There are many ways in which climate scientists can interact with soci- ety. Here we focus on the process of scientific research, identifying some good practices for building trustworthy and responsible models and then providing some resources. In creating and training models, we encourage researchers to recognize that science cannot claim to be purely “objective”, and that the choice of priors, data, and metrics all carry biases (e.g., [5]). Resolving or eliminating them is not realistic, as the interpretation of a “better” model or result is highly dependent on the user’s specific goal. Hence, it is crucial to be open and specific about the assumptions made, the algorithms and hyperparameters used, and the evaluation metrics and processes, and ideally to also make data and code available, following the principles of reproducible science (e.g., [6]). In evaluating and presenting the performance of statistical or machine learning models, considering possible failure modes can be a useful lens through which to examine systems’ behaviors. Good starting points are the taxonomy proposed by [7], which considers flaws in design, implementation, and communication, and, specifically for climate science, the list compiled by [8]. Failure modes that are particularly relevant for AI models from the climate domain include robustness under distribution shifts; for example, for models trained on his- torical data, it is difficult to predict how they will perform in the unseen conditions brought about by climate change. Good practices induced by consideration of failure modes may include efforts to quantify expected model performance through simulations, transparency in defining the anticipated range of applicability of the model, and considering how existing physics/climate knowledge can be applied in defining an evaluation strategy and in validating PLOS CLIMATE PLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000465 August 2, 2024 1 / 4 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Acquaviva V, Barnes EA, Gagne DJ, II, McKinley GA, Thais S (2024) Ethics in climate AI: From theory to practice.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. the generalization properties of the model. A related practice is to consider how the functional- ity lens changes and what failure modes become relevant when looking at the whole “phase space” of a model, intended as the array of different breakdowns of data, such as geographical areas, time periods, or user groups, as well as the broader socio-technical context in which a model can be used beyond the use case for which it was developed. In creating and distributing data sets, a term we use to indicate both observational data and other products such as outputs of Earth System Models, we begin by recognizing that we typi- cally don’t hold power on who will use the data and how the data will be used. We can, how- ever, aim to provide clear documentation on what dataset or numerical model creators thought of as desired and pertinent usage, as well as undesired, inappropriate, or wrong usage. Additionally, we can aim to be as transparent as possible in language and jargon in order to make climate information more widely accessible to a broad range of users and decision mak- ers; see, e.g., [9] for example of potential pitfalls when datasets are used across domains. A pos- sible pipeline to consider when creating data sets is provided by the Datasheets for Earth Science Datasets [10]. When possible, we propose to prefer AI models that are intrinsically interpretable (some- times defined as those built from pieces whose behavior is interpretable, such as decision trees or linear models) or explainable (sometimes defined as those whose behavior and decisions can be explained post hoc, for example, by means of a simpler surrogate model; see e.g., [11]). Interpretability and explainability can protect us from dangerous failure modes by creating insights into the ability of our model to generalize beyond the training domain, allowing us to check whether the explanation is consistent with our understanding of a physical system, and by allowing access to a wider and more inclusive user base, for example those who are not fully trained in or don’t have the resources to run more complex models, such as deep learning methods. However, applying explainability tools or using interpretable methods is not always possible or practical. We would like to propose a wider interpretation of explainability, which includes interrogating the system by exploring its responses to a wide range of inputs, includ- ing distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. In addition, we can perform physically informed perturbations of the system that act on the spatial, temporal or phenomenological scales of interest to assess their impact. By studying the behavior of AI systems under varied circum- stances, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding that is a proxy for explainability. An important reflection on encouraging the use of broadly-defined explainable models, as well as the need for clear documentation mentioned above, is that creating well-documented and explainable models can be a much slower process than using potentially more powerful, but black-box, methods. Generating physically meaningful features that can improve perfor- mance, implementing frameworks to enhance explainability, and writing documentation are time-consuming processes. Hence, rewarding the creation of such models requires a culture shift. Our current incen- tive structure is not built to reward this approach. Most often, the threshold for publication is set by an improvement in model performance typically measured by model accuracy on a pre- chosen data set. Furthermore, the measure of academic “success” (and in return, the chances to secure academic positions or grant funding, or to win awards) is heavily influenced by the number of papers and conference papers, creating pressure to publish more but not necessarily to curate impact. We can, however, challenge and change the status quo, by leading by example in our research, fostering a culture of explainable work in our labs, and appropriately reward- ing well-documented, explainable, robust, and broadly impactful work when evaluating papers, proposals, job applications, and nominations for awards. Besides being ethical, this culture shift in climate data science is made crucial by the fact that many private companies, including Google Deep Mind, NVIDIA, and Microsoft, are now PLOS CLIMATE PLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000465 August 2, 2024 2 / 4 racing ahead of academic centers in building complex machine learning-based climate and weather models (e.g., [12]). With very few exceptions, the computational resources available to universities won’t match those offered by tech giants, but we can and must retain the impor- tant role of creating generalizable insights and providing, with each of our papers and prod- ucts, a foundation for others to improve on our work. If we collaborate or work for these private companies, we should also remain aware of the potential for them to limit access to the information we produce. Finally, we would like to emphasize that ethical AI and science are intertwined, interdepen- dent topics. We should begin to include ethics in the climate science discourse, starting in the classroom. It is important to have these conversations in undergraduate and graduate courses and to integrate relevant resources in the climate science curricula, as well as at climate science conferences through special sessions. Starting points for such conversations include: • The lectures of the Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Science 2022 Sum- mer School [13]; • AI Ethics Education for Scientists [14]; • AI Ethics and Fundamental Physics [15]. The benefits of applying principles of ethical AI in scientific inquiry and to reward explain- ability, robustness, and trustworthiness are many: making more information available to more people, empowering communities affected by climate change, making climate research more impactful and accessible, and increasing the level of interaction and trust between climate sci- entists and society. This comes at the price of a culture shift where scientists are called to build models and data sets according to certain principles, to change the system of incentives in order to reward slower but more robust, explainable, and transparent work, and to engage in discussing and teaching the ethical aspects of climate data science as early as possible.

This article discusses the integration of ethics in climate AI, emphasizing its importance in addressing societal issues like resource access and public health. Climate AI models can be biased if data disparities are ignored, often being more accurate where data is dense—which typically aligns with wealthier regions. Ethical AI in climate science requires transparency regarding data and model assumptions, promoting reproducible science. It suggests using interpretable AI models and insists on openness about the limitations and potential biases inherent in AI systems.

Collaboration and ethical considerations in AI are vital to empower affected communities and make climate research more accessible. The work calls for a culture shift to reward explainable and robust research over just rapid publication. Encouraging ethical considerations in climate science education is also emphasized to foster responsible AI development.

John McCarthy Computer Science Department Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 jmc@cs.stanford.edu http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/ 2007 Nov 12, 2:05 a.m. Revised November 12, 2007: Abstract This article for the layman answers basic questions about artificial intelligence. The opinions expressed here are not all consensus opinion among researchers in AI. 1 Basic Questions Q. What is artificial intelligence? A. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, es- pecially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. Q. Yes, but what is intelligence? A. Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines. Q. Isn’t there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn’t depend on relating it to human intelligence? 2 A. Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent. We understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others. Q. Is intelligence a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question “Is this machine intelligent or not?”? A. No. Intelligence involves mechanisms, and AI research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others. If doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today, computer pro- grams can give very impressive performances on these tasks. Such programs should be considered “somewhat intelligent”. Q. Isn’t AI about simulating human intelligence? A. Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use meth- ods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do. Q. What about IQ? Do computer programs have IQs? A. No. IQ is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children. It is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the child’s age. The scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. IQ correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life, but making computers that can score high on IQ tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness. For example, the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities, perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with at once. However, “digit span” is trivial for even extremely limited computers. However, some of the problems on IQ tests are useful challenges for AI. Q. What about other comparisons between human and computer intelli- gence? Arthur R. Jensen [Jen98], a leading researcher in human intelligence, suggests “as a heuristic hypothesis” that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that diﬀerences in intelligence are related to “quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions”. I see them as speed, short term memory, and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories. Whether or not Jensen is right about human intelligence, the situation in 3 AI today is the reverse. Computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs. Some abilities that children normally don’t develop till they are teenagers may be in, and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are. Very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for AI can usefully be diﬀerent from that in people. Whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people, this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task eﬃciently. Q. When did AI research start? A. After WWII, a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines. The English mathematician Alan Turing may have been the first. He gave a lecture on it in 1947. He also may have been the first to decide that AI was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines. By the late 1950s, there were many researchers on AI, and most of them were basing their work on programming computers. Q. Does AI aim to put the human mind into the computer? A. Some researchers say they have that objective, but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically. The human mind has a lot of peculiarities, and I’m not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them. Q. What is the Turing test? A. Alan Turing’s 1950 article Computing Machinery and Intelligence [Tur50] discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent. He argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledge- able observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent. This test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers. The observer could in- teract with the machine and a human by teletype (to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person), and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer. The Turing test is a one-sided test. A machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent, but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human. Daniel Dennett’s book Brainchildren [Den98] has an excellent discussion 4 of the Turing test and the various partial Turing tests that have been im- plemented, i.e. with restrictions on the observer’s knowledge of AI and the subject matter of questioning. It turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent. Q. Does AI aim at human-level intelligence? A. Yes. The ultimate eﬀort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans. However, many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious. Q. How far is AI from reaching human-level intelligence? When will it happen? A. A few people think that human-level intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for ex- pressing knowledge. However, most AI researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required, and therefore it cannot be predicted when human-level intelligence will be achieved. Q. Are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent? A. Computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine. Many researchers invented non-computer machines, hoping that they would be intelligent in diﬀerent ways than the computer programs could be. However, they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building. Because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster, another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine. Q. Are computers fast enough to be intelligent? A. Some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas. My own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them. Of course, quite apart from the ambitions of AI researchers, computers will keep getting faster. Q. What about parallel machines? A. Machines with many processors are much faster than single proces- sors can be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary to face this awkwardness. Q. What about making a “child machine” that could improve by reading and by learning from experience? 5 A. This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s. Even- tually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven’t yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading. Q. Might an AI system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about AI? A. I think yes, but we aren’t yet at a level of AI at which this process can begin. Q. What about chess? A. Alexander Kronrod, a Russian AI researcher, said “Chess is the Drosophila of AI.” He was making an analogy with geneticists’ use of that fruit fly to study inheritance. Playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others. Chess programs now play at grandmaster level, but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player, substituting large amounts of computation for understanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can build human-level chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs. Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making com- puters play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific do- main. It is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their eﬀorts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races. Q. What about Go? A. The Chinese and Japanese game of Go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving. Go exposes the weakness of our present under- standing of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing. Go programs are very bad players, in spite of considerable eﬀort (not as much as for chess). The problem seems to be that a position in Go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction. Humans use this in chess also, but chess programs consider the position as a whole. Chess programs com- pensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or, in the case of Deep Blue, many millions of times as much computation. Sooner or later, AI research will overcome this scandalous weakness. Q. Don’t some people say that AI is a bad idea? A. The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological ma- chine being intelligent is incoherent. He proposes the Chinese room argument www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/chinese.html The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus 6 says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn’t reached human level by now, it must be impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt. Q. Aren’t computability theory and computational complexity the keys to AI? [Note to the layman and beginners in computer science: These are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science, and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical.] A. No. These theories are relevant but don’t address the fundamental problems of AI. In the 1930s mathematical logicians, especially Kurt G¨odel and Alan Tur- ing, established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains. Whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example, and whether a poly- nomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another. Hu- mans solve problems in these domains all the time, and this has been oﬀered as an argument (usually with some decorations) that computers are intrinsi- cally incapable of doing what people do. Roger Penrose claims this. However, people can’t guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either. See my Review of The Emperor’s New Mind by Roger Penrose. More essays and reviews defending AI research are in [McC96a]. In the 1960s computer scientists, especially Steve Cook and Richard Karp developed the theory of NP-complete problem domains. Problems in these domains are solvable, but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem. Which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an NP-complete problem domain. Humans often solve problems in NP-complete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms, but can’t solve them quickly in general. What is important for AI is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems. The identification of subdomains for which good algo- rithms exist is important, but a lot of AI problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains. The theory of the diﬃculty of general classes of problems is called com- putational complexity. So far this theory hasn’t interacted with AI as much as might have been hoped. Success in problem solving by humans and by AI programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the AI community 7 have been able to identify precisely. Algorithmic complexity theory as developed by Solomonoﬀ, Kolmogorov and Chaitin (independently of one another) is also relevant. It defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it. Proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem, but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you can’t prove that the program is the shortest. 2 Branches of AI Q. What are the branches of AI? A. Here’s a list, but some branches are surely missing, because no-one has identified them yet. Some of these may be regarded as concepts or topics rather than full branches. logical AI What a program knows about the world in general the facts of the specific situation in which it must act, and its goals are all represented by sentences of some mathematical logical language. The program decides what to do by inferring that certain actions are ap- propriate for achieving its goals. The first article proposing this was [McC59]. [McC89] is a more recent summary. [McC96b] lists some of the concepts involved in logical aI. [Sha97] is an important text. search AI programs often examine large numbers of possibilities, e.g. moves in a chess game or inferences by a theorem proving program. Discover- ies are continually made about how to do this more eﬃciently in various domains. pattern recognition When a program makes observations of some kind, it is often programmed to compare what it sees with a pattern. For example, a vision program may try to match a pattern of eyes and a nose in a scene in order to find a face. More complex patterns, e.g. in a natural language text, in a chess position, or in the history of some event are also studied. These more complex patterns require quite diﬀerent methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied the most. 8 representation Facts about the world have to be represented in some way. Usually languages of mathematical logic are used. inference From some facts, others can be inferred. Mathematical logical deduction is adequate for some purposes, but new methods of non- monotonic inference have been added to logic since the 1970s. The simplest kind of non-monotonic reasoning is default reasoning in which a conclusion is to be inferred by default, but the conclusion can be withdrawn if there is evidence to the contrary. For example, when we hear of a bird, we man infer that it can fly, but this conclusion can be reversed when we hear that it is a penguin. It is the possibil- ity that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that constitutes the non-monotonic character of the reasoning. Ordinary logical reasoning is monotonic in that the set of conclusions that can the drawn from a set of premises is a monotonic increasing function of the premises. Circumscription is another form of non-monotonic reasoning. common sense knowledge and reasoning This is the area in which AI is farthest from human-level, in spite of the fact that it has been an active research area since the 1950s. While there has been considerable progress, e.g. in developing systems of non-monotonic reasoning and theories of action, yet more new ideas are needed. The Cyc system contains a large but spotty collection of common sense facts. learning from experience Programs do that. The approaches to AI based on connectionism and neural nets specialize in that. There is also learn- ing of laws expressed in logic. [Mit97] is a comprehensive undergrad- uate text on machine learning. Programs can only learn what facts or behaviors their formalisms can represent, and unfortunately learn- ing systems are almost all based on very limited abilities to represent information. planning Planning programs start with general facts about the world (es- pecially facts about the eﬀects of actions), facts about the particular situation and a statement of a goal. From these, they generate a strat- egy for achieving the goal. In the most common cases, the strategy is just a sequence of actions. epistemology This is a study of the kinds of knowledge that are required for solving problems in the world. 9 ontology Ontology is the study of the kinds of things that exist. In AI, the programs and sentences deal with various kinds of objects, and we study what these kinds are and what their basic properties are. Emphasis on ontology begins in the 1990s. heuristics A heuristic is a way of trying to discover something or an idea imbedded in a program. The term is used variously in AI. Heuristic functions are used in some approaches to search to measure how far a node in a search tree seems to be from a goal. Heuristic predicates that compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than the other, i.e. constitutes an advance toward the goal, may be more useful. [My opinion]. genetic programming Genetic programming is a technique for getting pro- grams to solve a task by mating random Lisp programs and selecting fittest in millions of generations. It is being developed by John Koza’s group and here’s a tutorial1 . 3 Applications of AI Q. What are the applications of AI? A. Here are some. game playing You can buy machines that can play master level chess for a few hundred dollars. There is some AI in them, but they play well against people mainly through brute force computation—looking at hundreds of thousands of positions. To beat a world champion by brute force and known reliable heuristics requires being able to look at 200 million positions per second. speech recognition In the 1990s, computer speech recognition reached a practical level for limited purposes. Thus United Airlines has replaced its keyboard tree for flight information by a system using speech recog- nition of flight numbers and city names. It is quite convenient. On the the other hand, while it is possible to instruct some computers using speech, most users have gone back to the keyboard and the mouse as still more convenient. 1http://www.genetic-programming.com/gpanimatedtutorial.html 10 understanding natural language Just getting a sequence of words into a computer is not enough. Parsing sentences is not enough either. The computer has to be provided with an understanding of the domain the text is about, and this is presently possible only for very limited domains. computer vision The world is composed of three-dimensional objects, but the inputs to the human eye and computers’ TV cameras are two di- mensional. Some useful programs can work solely in two dimensions, but full computer vision requires partial three-dimensional informa- tion that is not just a set of two-dimensional views. At present there are only limited ways of representing three-dimensional information di- rectly, and they are not as good as what humans evidently use. expert systems A “knowledge engineer” interviews experts in a certain do- main and tries to embody their knowledge in a computer program for carrying out some task. How well this works depends on whether the intellectual mechanisms required for the task are within the present state of AI. When this turned out not to be so, there were many dis- appointing results. One of the first expert systems was MYCIN in 1974, which diagnosed bacterial infections of the blood and suggested treatments. It did better than medical students or practicing doctors, provided its limitations were observed. Namely, its ontology included bacteria, symptoms, and treatments and did not include patients, doc- tors, hospitals, death, recovery, and events occurring in time. Its in- teractions depended on a single patient being considered. Since the experts consulted by the knowledge engineers knew about patients, doctors, death, recovery, etc., it is clear that the knowledge engineers forced what the experts told them into a predetermined framework. In the present state of AI, this has to be true. The usefulness of current expert systems depends on their users having common sense. heuristic classification One of the most feasible kinds of expert system given the present knowledge of AI is to put some information in one of a fixed set of categories using several sources of information. An example is advising whether to accept a proposed credit card purchase. Information is available about the owner of the credit card, his record of payment and also about the item he is buying and about the estab- lishment from which he is buying it (e.g., about whether there have 11 been previous credit card frauds at this establishment). 4 More questions Q. How is AI research done? A. AI research has both theoretical and experimental sides. The experi- mental side has both basic and applied aspects. There are two main lines of research. One is biological, based on the idea that since humans are intelligent, AI should study humans and imitate their psychology or physiology. The other is phenomenal, based on studying and formalizing common sense facts about the world and the problems that the world presents to the achievement of goals. The two approaches interact to some extent, and both should eventually succeed. It is a race, but both racers seem to be walking. Q. What are the relations between AI and philosophy? A. AI has many relations with philosophy, especially modern analytic philosophy. Both study mind, and both study common sense. The best reference is [Tho03]. Q. How are AI and logic programming related? A. At the very least, logic programming provides useful programming languages (mainly Prolog). Beyond that, sometimes a theory T useful in AI can be expressed as a col- lection H of Horn clauses, and goal G to be achieved can be expressed as that of finding values of variables x1 . . . xn satisfying an expression g(x1 . . . xn). The problem can sometimes be solved by running the Prolog program con- sisting of G and H. There are two possible obstacles to regarding AI as logic programming. First, Horn theories do not exhaust first order logic. Second, the Prolog program expressing the theory may be extremely ineﬃcient. More elaborate control than just executing the program that expresses the theory is often needed. Map coloring provides examples. Q. What should I study before or while learning AI? A. Study mathematics, especially mathematical logic. The more you learn about sciences, e.g. physics or biology, the better. For the biological approaches to AI, study psychology and the physiology of the nervous system. Learn some programming languages—at least C, Lisp and Prolog. It is also a good idea to learn one basic machine language. Jobs are likely to depend on 12 knowing the languages currently in fashion. In the late 1990s, these include C++ and Java. Q. What is a good textbook on AI? A. Artificial Intelligence by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Prentice Hall is the most commonly used textbbook in 1997. The general views expressed there do not exactly correspond to those of this essay. Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis by Nils Nilsson, Morgan Kaufman, may be easier to read. Some people prefer Computational Intelligence by David Poole, Alan Mack- worth and Randy Goebel, Oxford, 1998. Q. What organizations and publications are concerned with AI? A. The American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)2, the Eu- ropean Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI)3 and the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behavior (AISB)4 are scientific societies concerned with AI research. The Association for Comput- ing Machinery (ACM) has a special interest group on artificial intelligence SIGART5 . The International Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI)6 is the main inter- national conference. The AAAI7 runs a US National Conference on AI. Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence8 , Artificial Intelligence9 , and Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research10, and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence11 are four of the main journals publishing AI research papers.

AI is the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines and programs. While related to understanding human intelligence, AI doesn't need to mimic biologically observable methods. Intelligence is seen as the ability to achieve goals and AI involves developing mechanisms for computers to perform tasks. The field's history traces back to the mid-20th century, with Alan Turing as a notable figure. AI encompasses various branches like logical AI, pattern recognition, and machine learning. Applications include game playing, speech recognition, and expert systems. Though some philosophical objections exist, AI research continues to explore human-level intelligence. Various organizations and conferences support AI research and dialogue.
